In this paper, we use longitudinal data collected directly from the game to examine play and grouping patterns in one of the largest MMOGs: World of Warcraft. Our observations show that the prevalence and extent of social activities in MMOGs might have been previously over-estimated, and that gaming communities face important challenges affecting their cohesion and eventual longevity. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of future games and other online social spaces.",2006,9/22/2015 3:44,407�416,,,,,,"""Alone Together?",CHI '06,,,,ACM,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In today's organizations, intra and interorganizational work systems are increasingly IT-enabled. Available evidence, however, suggests the functional potential of these installed IT applications is underutilized. Most IT users apply a narrow band of features, operate at low levels of feature use, and rarely initiate extensions of the available features. We argue that organizations need aggressive tactics to encourage users to expand their use of installed IT-enabled work systems. This article strives to accomplish three primary research objectives. First, we offer a comprehensive research model aimed both at coalescing existing research on post-adoptive IT use behaviors and at directing future research on those factors that influence users to (continuously) exploit and extend the functionality built into IT applications. Second, in developing this comprehensive research model, we provide a window (for researchers across a variety of scientific disciplines interested in technology management) into the rich body of research regarding IT adoption, use, and diffusion. Finally, we discuss implications and recommend guidelines for research and practice.

Such a perspective attends mainly to the use of information. Increasingly, however, organizations are concerned about the production of information. This paper focuses on the work of producing informational objects, an activity central to knowledge work. Based on data collected during an eight-month ethnographic study of three groups of knowledge workers-computer system administrators, competitive intelligence analysts, and librarians-I explore the informing practices they relied upon. These are identified as ex-pressing, monitoring, and translating. Common to these informing practices is the knowledge workers' endeavor to balance subjectivity and objectivity, where subjectivity is a necessary part of doing value adding work and objectivity promises workers authority and a sense of security. Recognizing that researchers are knowledge workers too, I draw on my own experiences as an ethnographic researcher to identify parallels between my informing practices and those of the knowledge workers I studied. These parallels are intended to challenge the taken-for-granted assumptions underlying scientific practice. I adopt a confessional genre of representation for this purpose.",2000,11/16/2015 1:45,Mar-41,,1,24,,MIS Quarterly,,,,,,,,,,,,,JSTOR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EKPs are organizational activity patterns that exhibit 3 characteristics in combination: 1. an emergent process of deliberations with no best structure or sequence, 2. requirements for knowledge that are complex, distributed across people, and evolving dynamically, and 3. an actor set that is unpredictable in terms of job roles or prior knowledge. Examples of EKPs include basic research, new product development, strategic business planning, and organization design. A new IS design theory was created while designing and deploying a system for the EKP of organization design. The system was demonstrated through subsequent empirical analysis to be successful in supporting the process. This new IS design theory is an important theoretical contribution, because it both provides guidance to developers and sets an agenda for academic research.",2002-09,3/21/2016 1:32,179-212,,3,26,,,,,,,,,,English,"Copyright University of Minnesota, MIS Research Center Sep 2002",,,,ProQuest,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its central theme is that organizational knowledge is created through a continuous dialogue between tacit and explicit knowledge. The nature of this dialogue is examined and four patterns of interaction involving tacit and explicit knowledge are identified. It is argued that while new knowledge is developed by individuals, organizations play a critical role in articulating and amplifying that knowledge. A theoretical framework is developed which provides an analytical perspective on the constituent dimensions of knowledge creation. This framework is then applied in two operational models for facilitating the dynamic creation of appropriate organizational knowledge.",1994,11/15/2015 1:00,14-37,,1,5,,Organization Science,,,,,,,,,,,,,JSTOR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Owing to the vague concepts frequently represented in decision environments, we have proposed a fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making procedure, to facilitate data warehouse system selection, with consideration given to both technical and managerial criteria. The procedure can systematically construct the objectives of DW systems selection to support the business goals and requirements of an organization, and identify the appropriate attributes or criteria for evaluation. In the fuzzy-based method, the weight of each criterion and the rating of each alternative are described using linguistic terms, which can also be expressed as triangular fuzzy numbers. The fuzzy algorithm aggregated the decision-makers� preference rating for criteria, and the suitability of data warehouse alternatives versus the selection criteria, to calculate fuzzy appropriateness indices, through which, the most suitable data warehouse system was determined. A case study of a Bar Code Implementation Project for Agricultural Products in Taiwan was conducted to illustrate this method�s effectiveness.",2007-04,4/14/2016 0:35,939-953,,3,32,,Expert Systems with Applications,,,,,,,,,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is important to understand these phenomena because they are strongly related to the staying power of technology. From a herd behavior perspective, this study proposes two new concepts, namely discounting one's own information and imitating others, to describe herd behavior in technology adoption. A research model is developed to describe the conditions under which herd behavior in technology adoption occurs, how it impacts technology adoption decision making, and how it influences post-adoptive system use. A longitudinal study is conducted to examine the research model. Findings from this research suggest that the discounting of one's own beliefs and the imitating of others when adopting a new technology are provoked primarily by the observation of prior adoptions and perceptions of uncertainty regarding the adoption of new technology. Herd behavior has a significant influence on user technology adoption; however, it does not necessarily lead to the collapse of the user base, as predicted in the herd literature. Instead, imitation can help reduce post-adoption regret and thus serve as a legitimate strategy for choosing a good enough technology, which may or may not be the best option to enhance job performance. People tend to adjust their beliefs when herding and also to revive their discounted initial beliefs to modify their beliefs about the technology at the post-adoptive stage. Findings from this study have significant research and practical implications.",2013-12,2/21/2016 22:14,1013-A13,,4,37,,MIS Quarterly,,,,,,,,,,,,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet some organizational behavior and MIS researchers have noted that individuals generally resist changes. MIS researchers have also attributed many implementation problems to users' resistance to change. However, there is no fundamental resistance to every change. Individuals readily adopt changes such as a pay raise or promotion. This article proposes that individuals attempt to evaluate most changes. Changes that are considered favorable are not resisted and may even be sought after and welcomed, while changes considered unfavorable are likely to be resisted. The equity-implementation (E-I) model provides a theory-based understanding of information systems users' resistance to change. It describes the processes employed by users in assessing the change associated with the implementation of an information system or technology in an organization. The model is based upon equity theory, which is a well-established and widely used theory in social sciences. Users employ three levels of analysis in evaluating the change introduced by an implementation. At the first level of analysis, a user is viewed as assessing a change in terms of the gain or loss in his or her equity status. At the second level of analysis, the user is viewed as comparing his or her relative outcomes with that of the organization. Finally, at the third level of analysis, the user is viewed as comparing his or her relative outcomes with that of other users in the reference group. Users who evaluate the change to be unfavorable in terms of inequity or loss of equity are likely to be distressed by the change and resist it. The E-I model provides a useful framework of analysis, for improving our understanding of users' assessment of a change. Managers will find the model useful for overcoming resistance to change during implementation.",6/1/1991,9/19/2015 21:32,229-242,,2,15,,MIS Quarterly,A Model of Users' Perspective on Change,,,,,,,,"Copyright � 1991 Management Information Systems Research Center, University of Minnesota",,,,JSTOR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We first assessed extant models of resistance to IT. Using semantic analysis, we identified five basic components of resistance: behaviors, object, subject, threats, and initial conditions. We further examined extant models to (1) carry out a preliminary specification of the nature of the relationships between these components and (2) refine our understanding of the multilevel nature of the phenomenon. Using analytic induction, we examined data from three case studies of clinical information systems implementations in hospital settings, focusing on physicians' resistance behaviors. The resulting mixed-determinants model suggests that group resistance behaviors vary during implementation. When a system is introduced, users in a group will first assess it in terms of the interplay between its features and individual and/or organizational-level initial conditions. They then make projections about the consequences of its use. If expected consequences are threatening, resistance behaviors will result. During implementation, should some trigger occur to either modify or activate an initial condition involving the balance of power between the group and other user groups, it will also modify the object of resistance, from system to system significance. If the relevant initial conditions pertain to the power of the resisting group vis-�-vis the system advocates, the object of resistance will also be modified, from system significance to system advocates. Resistance behaviors will follow if threats are perceived from the interaction between the object of resistance and initial conditions. We also found that the bottom-up process by which group resistance behaviors emerge from individual behaviors is not the same in early versus late implementation. In early implementation, the emergence process is one of compilation, described as a combination of independent, individual behaviors. In later stages of implementation, if group level initial conditions have become active, the emergence process is one of composition, described as the convergence of individual behaviors.",9/1/2005,9/16/2015 16:01,461-491,,3,29,,MIS Quarterly,,,,,,,,,"Copyright � 2005 Management Information Systems Research Center, University of Minnesota",,,,JSTOR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The field of information systems (IS) has evolved for more than three decades. Although many schools of thought have emerged and even become well established, few historical analyses of research paradigms and methodologies have been undertaken. One of the rare exceptions is Orlikowski & Baroudi (1991). Yet, the IS research community has evolved substantially since 1991 in many aspects. A variety of journal outlets have emerged and become well established. More attention has been paid to paradigmatic and methodological issues. Political and professional contexts have also changed noticeably. Therefore, it should be an opportune time for the field to ask: �What changes are manifested in journal publications?��Is the field making progress regarding pluralism in IS research?��How will the field's publications practices change in the future?� The purpose of this paper is to investigate these questions and, in turn, reflect on the paradigmatic and methodological progress made since 1991. We examined 1893 articles published in eight major IS publication outlets between 1991 and 2001. Our findings suggest that the long-term endeavours of interpretivist researchers might need to continue because the paradigmatic progress appears somewhat inconsequential; positivist research still dominates 81% of published empirical research. In particular, US journals, as opposed to European journals, tend to be more positivist, quantitative, cross-sectional and survey oriented. With respect to research design, survey research is still the most widely used method (41%), although case studies have gained substantial recognition (36%). Further, the increase of qualitative research (30%), empirical studies (61%) and longitudinal cases (33%) at the expense of laboratory experiments (18%) might suggest that IS researchers have become more interested in obtaining scientific knowledge in real world settings. In summary, we suggest that the field has been dominated by the positivist paradigm, despite calls to the contrary. Indeed, if the field was to truly embrace pluralism, it would have to find ways to fundamentally change the publication practices of the journal system, including the current tenure and promotion system, which pose considerable obstacles for the acceptance of alternative paradigms.",7/1/2004,5/4/2016 21:33,197-235,,3,14,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many more are spending large sums of money implementing these systems, hoping for competitive advantage. However, reported results have been mixed. In this paper, we use a process theory approach to analyze one organization's implementation experience. We examine the four phases of the ERP process model - Chartering, Project, Shakedown, and Onwards and Upward (Markus and Tanis, 1999), and identify the interaction among conditions and events that resulted in the mixed results experienced by the organization. We believe that the framework, based on a process theory approach, is useful for understanding and explaining the ERP experiences of organizations. It provides a structure for identifying the major sources of process losses at each phase. Research in future can use this framework for systematic study across multiple cases to theoretically validate the sources of process losses and their relationship to impacts. Cumulative and systematic documentation and analysis of multiple case studies will contribute over time to better understanding of ERP implementations and help to increase the level of organizational success with ERPs",2000,,23-Apr,,1,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In other words, a surge in the numbers of users creating and signing up for accounts does not necessarily mean the increasing volume of members brings value to the community. In reality, engagement requires time and work, and achieving real success here means taking and applying measures that improve the success and sustainability of the community. Engagement is essential for the success of any community, be it online or offline, because it contributes to and changes the way people connect in communities. This review article attempts to uncover types of engagement that emerge from structure, elements, characteristics and phenomenon of online communities. We start by conducting a literature review of online community in the information systems literature and conceptualize the resulting 164 peer-reviewed articles into themes of online community research emphasizing design, member behavior, development and organizational impact. Building upon these themes, we propose a theory of engagement in online communities that highlights configurations for purposeful, experiential, functional, relational, expositional and beneficial forms of engagement. We also discuss the review�s contributions to both theory and practice, implications and opportunities for future studies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

XFG56A2C,book,1994,"Davis, Gordon B.",A Strategy for Becoming a Worldclass Scholar in Information Systems,,,,,,"I am frequently asked by new academics what they should do to get promoted and establish themselves as scholars in the field. The academics have a way of stating the issue: �Publish or perish. � What does it mean for a research and publication strategy? Also, I get inquiries from practitioners about academic experts on a certain topic. They frequently comment about the lack of research on the �real � problems. This paper will describe a research and publication strategy that has a high probability of success in turning a young academic into a respected world-class scholar and achieving promotion and tenure. The strategy also provides insight for practitioners who wish to identify good scholars in a given subject area and encourage relevant research. The paper is written as a tutorial for doctoral students and faculty members in information systems, but it can provide reminders for experienced researchers as well. THE ACADEMIC SETTING FOR AN INDIVIDUAL STRATEGY The academic world can be divided into three types of institutions: those that emphasize research, those that emphasize teaching, and those that are ambivalent. The institutions may talk the same way about the need for teaching, research, and service, but the reward structure is different. For example, the reward system for research institutions is based on research. Teaching is still valued in the research institution, but teaching is a screening rather than a reward factor. In other words, poor teaching will be detrimental to promotion, but good teaching will bring praise rather than promotion. Likewise, unwillingness to perform minimal service may be detrimental, but high levels of service will not bring promotion. The emphasis of this paper is on research and becoming a world-class scholar.",1994,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,CiteSeer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a case study approach and extensive interviews, the researchers found that a SAP system was rigid, highly structured and ignored by some elements of the social system. Moreover, it focused on technical prowess of the SAP solution at the apparent expense of supporting real-world activity. Such a focus allowed the spontaneous creation of 'feral systems' that involved ad hoc processes used to get around the SAP solution, to complete important work. This paper begins with an analysis of the feral systems concept and then examines the case study of feral systems in the organisation in question.

We suggest that severe restrictions on these capacities in the form of what we call functional stupidity are an equally important if under-recognized part of organizational life. Functional stupidity refers to an absence of reflexivity, a refusal to use intellectual capacities in other than myopic ways, and avoidance of justifications. We argue that functional stupidity is prevalent in contexts dominated by economy in persuasion which emphasizes image and symbolic manipulation. This gives rise to forms of stupidity management that repress or marginalize doubt and block communicative action. In turn, this structures individuals' internal conversations in ways that emphasize positive and coherent narratives and marginalize more negative or ambiguous ones. This can have productive outcomes such as providing a degree of certainty for individuals and organizations. But it can have corrosive consequences such as creating a sense of dissonance among individuals and the organization as a whole. The positive consequences can give rise to self-reinforcing stupidity. The negative consequences can spark dialogue, which may undermine functional stupidity.",11/1/2012,2/9/2016 1:58,1194-1220,,7,49,,,,,,,,,,en,� 2012 The Authors.

Notwithstanding the contributions of research to date, our knowledge of how culture influences--and is influenced by--the development and use processes and an information system itself remains fragmented. Knowledge fragmentation is amplified by the fact that conceptualizations of culture differ among researchers. Indeed, most researchers agree that culture consists of patterns of meaning underlying a variety of manifestations. Researchers diverge, however, on the degree of consensus on these interpretations that they assume to be reached within a collective. In order to integrate these divergent conceptualizations of culture, we adopt the view that no single perspective is sufficient to capture the complexity of interplay between culture, the processes of developing and using an IS, and the IS itself. We have, therefore, adopted a conceptualization that views culture from three perspectives--integration, differentiation, and fragmentation--that come into play simultaneously and jointly. Using this conceptualization, the paper synthesizes what is known about the role of culture in IS initiatives, and proposes a model of the relationships between culture, the development and use processes, and an information system.",2008-09,2/8/2016 0:46,601-634,,3,32,,MIS Quarterly,,,,,,,,,,,,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

El",Absorptive Capacity Configurations in Supply Chains: Gearing for Partner-Enabled Market Knowledge Creation,MIS Quarterly,,0276-7783,,http://www.jstor.org/stable/25148671,"The need for continual value innovation is driving supply chains to evolve from a pure transactional focus to leveraging interorganizational partner ships for sharing information and, ultimately, market knowledge creation. Supply chain partners are (1) engaging in interlinked processes that enable rich (broad-ranging, high quality, and privileged) information sharing, and (2) building information technology infrastructures that allow them to process information obtained from their partners to create new knowledge. This study uncovers and examines the variety of supply chain partnership configurations that exist based on differences in capability platforms, reflecting varying processes and information systems. We use the absorptive capacity lens to build a conceptual framework that links these configurations with partner-enabled market knowledge creation. Absorptive capacity refers to the set of organizational routines and processes by which organizations acquire, assimilate, transform, and exploit knowledge to produce dynamic organizational capabilities. Through an exploratory field study conducted in the context of the RosettaNet consortium effort in the IT industry supply chain, we use cluster analysis to uncover and characterize five supply chain partnership configurations (collectors, connectors, crunchers, coercers, and collaborators). We compare their partner-enabled knowledge creation and operational efficiency, as well as the shortcomings in their capability platforms and the nature of information exchange. Through the characterization of each of the configurations, we are able to derive research propositions focused on enterprise absorptive capacity elements. These propositions provide insight into how partner-enabled market knowledge creation and operational efficiency can be affected, and highlight the interconnected roles of coordination information and rich information. The paper concludes by drawing implications for research and practice from the uncovering of these configurations and the resultant research propositions. It also highlights fertile opportunities for advances in research on knowledge management through the study of supply chain contexts and other interorganizational partnering arrangements.",2005,7/23/2016 23:13,145-187,,1,29,,MIS Quarterly,Absorptive Capacity Configurations in Supply Chains,,,,,,,,,,,,JSTOR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast to a logic of determination, a logic of opposition explains organizational change by identifying forces both promoting change and impeding change. Four specific theories are considered: organizational politics, organizational culture, institutional theory, and organizational learning. Each theory is briefly described to illustrate its usefulness to the problem of explaining information technology's role in organizational change. Four methodological implications of using these theories are also discussed: empirical identification of opposing forces, statement of opposing hypotheses, process research, and employing multiple interpretations.",6/1/1999,9/24/2015 22:02,167-185,,2,10,,Information Systems Research,Accounting for the Contradictory Organizational Consequences of Information Technology,,,,,,,,,,,,pubsonline.informs.org (Atypon),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They value technological rigor at the cost of organizational relevance, and fail to recognize that the artifact emerges from interaction with the organizational context even when its initial design is guided by the researchers� intent. We propose action design research (ADR) as a new DR method to address this problem. ADR reflects the premise that IT artifacts are ensembles shaped by the organizational context during development and use. The method conceptualizes the research process as containing the inseparable and inherently interwoven activities of building the IT artifact, intervening in the organization, and evaluating it concurrently.

We develop a model of technology adaptation behaviors that employees perform to cope with a new IT that causes such disruptions. Our model posits technology adaptation behaviors as a key linking mechanism between IT implementation and employee job outcomes, thus offering a holistic nomological network of technology adaptation behaviors. Two field studies conducted over a period of six months, with four waves of data collection each, in two organizations (N = 211 and N = 181) implementing two different ITs, supported the model. We found that employees performed four different technology adaptation behaviors�exploration-to-innovate, exploitation, exploration-to-revert, and avoidance�based on whether they appraised an IT as an opportunity or a threat and whether they had perceptions of control over an IT. Employees� experiential engagements (i.e., user participation and training effectiveness) and psychological engagements (i.e., user involvement and management support) during the implementation jointly determined their appraisal of an IT. Finally, we found that technology adaptation behaviors influenced changes in two key job outcomes, job performance and job satisfaction.

To understand the critical resources that contribute to digital inequality and inform public policy for stimulating initial and continued ICT usage by the SED, we drew on capital theories and conducted a field study to investigate: (1) the forms of capital for using ICT and how they differ across potential adopters who are SED and socioeconomically advantaged (SEA); (2) how these forms of capitals are relatively impacted for the SEA and the SED through public policy for ICT access; and (3) how each form of capital influences the SED's intentions to use initially and to continue to use ICT. The context for our study involved a city in the southeastern United States that offered its citizens free ICT access for Internet connectivity. Our results show that SED potential adopters exhibited lower cultural capital but higher social capital relative to the SEA. Moreover, the SED who participated in the city's initiative realized greater positive gains in cultural capital, social capital, and habitus than the SEA. In addition, we find that the SED's initial intention to use ICT was influenced by intrinsic motivation for habitus, self-efficacy for cultural capital, and important referents' expectations and support from acquaintances for social capital. Cultural capital and social cultural capital also complemented each other in driving the SED's initial use intention. The SED's continued use intention was affected by both intrinsic and extrinsic motivations for habitus and both knowledge and self-efficacy for cultural capital but was not affected by social capital. We also make several recommendations for future research on digital inequality and ICT acceptance to extend and apply the proposed capital framework.",2011,2/18/2016 22:40,233-253,,2,22,,Information Systems Research,Addressing Digital Inequality for the Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Through Government Initiatives,,,,,,,,,,,,JSTOR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, the vendor selection of a telecommunications system is a complex multi-person, multi-criteria decision problem. The group decision-making process can be improved by a systematic and logical approach to assess priorities based on the inputs of several people from different functional areas within the company. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) can be very useful in involving several decision-makers with different conflicting objectives to arrive at a consensus decision. In this paper, an AHP-based model is formulated and applied to a real case study to examine its feasibility in selecting a vendor for a telecommunications system. The use of the proposed model indicates that it can be applied to improve the group decision making in selecting a vendor that satisfies customer specifications. Also, it is found that the decision process is systematic and that using the proposed AHP model can reduce the time taken to select a vendor.",2001-04,2/21/2016 22:08,171-182,,2,29,,Omega,,,,,,,,,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on a cross-sectional sample of 147 multinationals and a structural equation methodology, this study empirically investigates the simultaneous effects of learning intent, learning capacity (LC), knowledge ambiguity, and its two key antecedents � tacitness and partner protectiveness � on technological knowledge transfer. In the interest of expanding our understanding of the organizational mechanisms that both hinder and facilitate learning, the concept of LC is refined into three distinct components: resource-, incentive-, and cognitive-based LC. Further, the strength of the relationships between these theoretical constructs and knowledge transfer is examined in light of the possible moderating effects of organizational culture, firm size, and the form and competitive regime of the alliance. Consistently, learning intent (as a driver) and knowledge ambiguity (as an impediment) emerge as the most significant determinants of knowledge transfer. Moreover, the effects of partner protectiveness and LC on the learning outcome are moderated by the firm's own culture towards learning, the size of the firm, the structural form of the alliance, and the fact that partners may or may not be competitors.",7/8/2004,7/24/2016 2:43,407-427,,5,35,,J Int Bus Stud,,,,,,,,en,,,,,link.springer.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

66SVUAQS,report,2014,,An Executive's Guide to Maximizing Production Assets,,,,,,"It�s common for large businesses to have hundreds of millions of dollars invested in production assets. And today, these assets � which range from factory machines to combustion turbines � are increasingly being viewed as strategic contributors to a company�s P&L. But traditional meter- and calendar-based preventive maintenance approaches make it difficult to maximize key metrics such as return on capital employed (ROCE) and return on capital invested (ROCI). Most organizations use basic monitoring consoles provided by their asset manufacturers to monitor equipment performance. These consoles are limited in scope with little emphasis on analytics, resulting in isolated views into separate tags of assets. This process is resource intensive, time consuming, subject to false alerts and driven primarily by domain knowledge and biased judgment. Because it�s focused on reactive rather than proactive maintenance, it can�t help companies prevent equipment failures and performance degradations to avoid the high cost of unplanned downtime. That�s why many forward-looking executives are turning to predictive maintenance (PdM) solutions that support an analytics-based approach to improving asset performance and uptime by predicting unplanned downtime and optimizing maintenance cycles. Leveraging real-time, critical asset operating information and risk and profitability analysis, companies can develop tailored asset management strategies that are tied to business performance. This paper explores the business case for investing in predictive maintenance solutions and examines how they work to lower maintenance costs and minimize asset performance-related disruptions across operations. It also describes what�s required to get started with predictive maintenance today",2014,,10-Jan,,,,,,,,,,,"SAS Campus Drive, Cary, North Carolina 27513, USA",,,,White Paper,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The method is simple and flexible with regard to domain and language, and takes into account the influence of aspect on sentiment polarity, an issue largely ignored in previous literature. We demonstrate its effectiveness on both component tasks, where it achieves similar results to more complex semi-supervised methods that are restricted by their reliance on manual annotation and extensive knowledge sources.",2010,9/30/2015 20:42,804�812,,,,,,,HLT '10,,,,Association for Computational Linguistics,"Stroudsburg, PA, USA",,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current discourse on this genre of research refers almost exclusively to �evocative autoethnography� that draws upon postmodern sensibilities and whose advocates distance themselves from realist and analytic ethnographic traditions. The dominance of evocative autoethnography has obscured recognition of the compatibility of autoethnographic research with more traditional ethnographic practices. The author proposes the term analytic autoethnography to refer to research in which the researcher is (1) a full member in the research group or setting, (2) visible as such a member in published texts, and (3) committed to developing theoretical understandings of broader social phenomena. After briefly tracing the history of proto-autoethnographic research among realist ethnographers, the author proposes five key features of analytic autoethnography.

For such systems, firms typically use consultants to aid in the implementation process. Client firms expect consultants to transfer their implementation knowledge to their employees so that they can contribute to successful implementations and learn to maintain the systems independent of the consultants. This study examines the antecedents of knowledge transfer in the context of such an interfirm complex information systems implementation environment. Drawing from the knowledge transfer, information systems, and communication literatures, an integrated theoretical model is developed that posits that knowledge transfer is influenced by knowledge-related, motivational, and communication-related factors. Data were collected from consultant-and-client matched-pair samples from 96 ERP implementation projects. Unlike most prior studies, a behavioral measure of knowledge transfer that incorporates the application of knowledge was used. The analysis suggests that all three groups of factors influence knowledge transfer, and provides support for 9 of the 13 hypotheses. The analysis also confirms two mediating relationships. These results (1) adapt prior research, primarily done in non-IS contexts, to the ERP implementation context, (2) enhance prior findings by confirming the significance of an antecedent that has previously shown mixed results, and (3) incorporate new IS-related constructs and measures in developing an integrated model that should be broadly applicable to the interfirm IS implementation context and other IS situations.

Virtual worlds are a prime example of such an equivocal innovative technology, and this affords researchers an opportunity to study sensemaking and the construction of perspectives about the organizational value of virtual worlds. This study reports on an analysis of the written assessments of 59 business professionals who spent an extended period of time in Second Life, a popular virtual world, and discursively made sense of the organizational value of virtual worlds. Through a Toulminian analysis of the claims, grounds, and warrants used in the texts they generated, we identify 12 common patterns of sensemaking and indicate that themes of confirmation, open-ended rhetoric, demographics, and control are evident in the different types of claims that were addressed. Further, we assert that the Toulminian approach we employ is a useful methodology for the study of sensemaking and one that is not bound to any particular theoretical perspective.",2011-09,4/14/2016 20:49,685-709,,3,35,,MIS Quarterly,Arguing the Value of Virtual Worlds,,,,,,,,,,,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the last 20 years, three primary modes of IT governance have become prevalent: centralized, decentralized, and the federal mode. These modes vary in the extent to which corporate IS, divisional IS, and line management are vested with authority for the key IT activities. While a significant volume of research has examined the influence of contingency factors on the choice of a specific mode of IT governance, most of this research has examined the singular effects of the contingency factors. The assumption underlying these studies is as though the organizational contingencies act in isolation in influencing the mode of IT governance. However, in reality, business firms are subject to the pulls and pressures of multiple, rather than singular, contingency forces. Therefore, to acknowledge this reality, this study applies the theory of multiple contingencies to examine how contingency forces influence the mode of IT governance. The theory argues that contingency forces interact with each other by either amplifying, dampening, or overriding their mutual influences on the IT governance mode. Three scenarios of multiple, interacting contingencies are identified: reinforcing, conflicting, and dominating. Each of these scenarios of multiple contingencies is hypothesized to influence a particular mode of IT governance. Utilizing rich data from case studies of eight firms, empirical evidence is presented to support these hypotheses. Implications of the multiple contingencies theory for research and for practice are presented.",1999,11/30/2015 4:11,261-290,,2,23,,MIS Quarterly,Arrangements for Information Technology Governance,,,,,,,,,,,,JSTOR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A survey study was conducted to determine the impact of the digital divide on students selfdirected learning in an information technology-based learning environment through their computer selfefficacy, and to assess the role of the school IT environment in bridging this digital divide. Partial least square analyses, with data from more than 5,000 middle school students, show many significant effects. Computer selfefficacy has an effect on self-directed learning. Home PC (personal computer) ownership has a significant effect on computer self-efficacy. The school IT environment affects the computer self-efficacy of students with or without a home PC in different ways. In general, a better perceived school IT environment has more impact on students without a home PC, and thus is important in reducing the impact of the digital divide. The findings provide strong evidence of the digital divide affecting computer self-efficacy and learning behavior, and support investments in improving school IT environments.",12/31/2002,,,,,,,,Bridging the Digital Divide,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Who has it, how it works, and how to develop it have become key questions as markets, organizations, and careers become more and more dependent on informal, discretionary relationships. The formal organization deals with accountability; Everything else flows through the informal: advice, coordination, cooperation friendship, gossip, knowledge, trust. Informal relations have always been with us, they have always mattered. What is new is the range of activities in which they now matter, and the emerging clarity we have about how they create advantage for certain people at the expense of others. This is done by brokerage and closure. Ronald S. Burt builds upon his celebrated work in this area to explore the nature of brokerage and closure. Brokerage is the activity of people who live at the intersection of social worlds, who have a vision advantage of seeing and developing good ideas, an advantage which can be seen in their compensation, recognition, and the responsibility they're entrusted with in comparison to their peers. Closure is the tightening of coordination in a closed network of people, and people who do this do well as a complement to brokers because of the trust and alignment they create. Brokerage and Closure explores how these elements work together to define social capital, showing how in the business world reputation has come to replace authority, pursued opportunity assignment, and reward has come to be associated with achieving competitive advantage in a social order of continuous disequilibrium.",8/11/2005,,,290,,,,,Brokerage and Closure,,,,,OUP Oxford,,en,,,,,Google Books,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Star analysts who switched employers experienced an immediate decline in performance that persisted for at least five years. This decline was most pronounced among star analysts who moved to firms with lesser capabilities and those who moved solo, without other team members. Star analysts who moved between two firms with equivalent capabilities also exhibited a drop in performance, but only for two years. Those who switched to firms with better capabilities and those who moved with other team members exhibited no significant decline in short-term or long-term performance. These findings suggest that firm-specific skills and firms' capabilities both play important roles in star analysts' performance. In addition, we find that firms that hire star analysts from competitors with better capabilities suffered more extreme negative stock-market reactions than those that hire from comparable or lesser firms. These findings suggest that hiring stars may be perceived as value destroying and may not improve a firm's competitive advantage.",2008-07,12/8/2015 3:01,1213-1230,,7,54,,Management Science,Can They Take It With Them?,,,,,,,,,,,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Developers and users of these systems hold high hopes for their potential to change organizations for the better, but actual changes often do not occur, or occur inconsistently. We propose adaptive struc- turation theory (AST) as a viable approach for studying the role of advanced information technologies in organization change. AST examines the change process from two vantage points: (1) the types of structures that are provided by advanced technologies, and (2) the structures that actually emerge in human action as people interact with these technologies. To illustrate the principles of AST, we consider the small group meeting and the use of a group decision support system (GDSS). A GDSS is an interesting technology for study because it can be structured in a myriad of ways, and social interaction unfolds as the GDSS is used. Both the structure of the technology and the emergent structure of social action can be studied. We begin by positioning AST among competing theoretical perspectives of technology and change. Next, we describe the theoretical roots and scope of the theory as it is applied to GDSS use and state the essential assumptions, concepts, and propositions of AST. We outline an analytic strategy for applying AST principles and provide an illustration of how our analytic approach can shed light on the impacts of advanced technologies on organizations. A major strength of AST is that it expounds the nature of social structures within advanced information technologies and the key interaction processes that figure in their use. By capturing these processes and tracing their impacts, we can reveal the complexity of technology-organization",1994-05,9/24/2015 1:00,121-147,,2,5,,Organization Science,Capturing the Complexity in Advanced Technology Use,,,,,,,,,,,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 3 studies, we investigate the contagion effect of rudeness and the cognitive mechanism that explains this effect. Study 1 results show that low-intensity negative behaviors like rudeness can be contagious, and that this contagion effect can occur based on single episodes, that anybody can be a carrier, and that this contagion effect has second-order consequences for future interaction partners. In Studies 2 and 3 we explore in the laboratory the cognitive mechanism that underlies the negative behavioral contagion effect observed in Study 1. Specifically, we show that rudeness activates a semantic network of related concepts in individuals� minds, and that this activation influences individual�s hostile behaviors. In sum, in these 3 studies we show that just like the common cold, common negative behaviors can spread easily and have significant consequences for people in organizations.

Borgatti,   Show more doi:10.1016/j.socnet.2004.11.008 Get rights and content Abstract Centrality measures, or at least popular interpretations of these measures, make implicit assumptions about the manner in which traffic flows through a network. For example, some measures count only geodesic paths, apparently assuming that whatever flows through the network only moves along the shortest possible paths. This paper lays out a typology of network flows based on two dimensions of variation, namely the kinds of trajectories that traffic may follow (geodesics, paths, trails, or walks) and the method of spread (broadcast, serial replication, or transfer). Measures of centrality are then matched to the kinds of flows that they are appropriate for. Simulations are used to examine the relationship between type of flow and the differential importance of nodes with respect to key measurements such as speed of reception of traffic and frequency of receiving traffic. It is shown that the off-the-shelf formulas for centrality measures are fully applicable only for the specific flow processes they are designed for, and that when they are applied to other flow processes they get the �wrong� answer. It is noted that the most commonly used centrality measures are not appropriate for most of the flows we are routinely interested in. A key claim made in this paper is that centrality measures can be regarded as generating expected values for certain kinds of node outcomes (such as speed and frequency of reception) given implicit models of how traffic flows, and that this provides a new and useful way of thinking about centrality.",2005-01,10/30/2015 5:04,55-71,,1,27,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,CrossRef,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, we show that in the presence of low uncertainty, centralization of data management decisions creates more total surplus for the firm as the similarity of business units increases. In contrast, in the presence of high uncertainty, centralization creates more total surplus as the dissimilarity of business units increases. The pivoting distinction trades the benefit of reduction of uncertainty from dissimilar businesses for centralization (with cost saving) against the benefit of flexibility from decentralization. Second, the framework helps senior management evaluate the trade-offs in data centralization that drive different business models of the firm. We illustrate the application of these propositions formally using an analytical model and informally using case vignettes and simulation.",2013,2/21/2016 22:20,179-212,,3,30,,Journal of Management Information Systems,,,,,,,,,,,,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, pioneering corporate co-creation systems fail to attract a satisfying level of participation and engagement. The experience users have with the co-creation system is the key to making virtual places a vibrant source of great connections, creativity, and co-creation. While prior research on co-creation serves as a foundation for this work, it does not provide adequate guidance on how to design co-creation systems in virtual worlds. To address this shortcoming, a 20-month action research project was conducted to study the user's experience and to identify design principles for virtual co-creation systems. In two action research cycles, a virtual co-creation system called Ideation Quest was created, deployed, evaluated, and improved. The study reveals how to design co-creation systems and enriches research on co-creation to fit the virtual world context.

In sponsored co-creation, which takes place at the behest of producers, the activities of consumers drive or support the producers' business models. Autonomous co-creation is a wide range of consumer activities that amount to consumer-side production of value. Thus, individuals and communities have become a significant, and growing, productive force in e-commerce. To recognize co-creation, so broadly understood, as a fundamental area of e-commerce research, it is necessary to attain an integrated research perspective on this greatly varied, yet cohering, domain. The enabling information technology needs to be developed to suit the context. Toward these ends, the paper analyzes the intellectual space underlying co-creation research and proposes an inclusive taxonomy of Web-based co-creation, informed both by the extant multidisciplinary research and by results obtained in the natural laboratory of the Web. The essential directions of co-creation research are outlined, and some promising avenues of future work discussed. The taxonomic framework and the research perspective lay a foundation for the future development of co-creation theory and practice. The certainty of turbulent developments in e-commerce means that the taxonomic framework will require ongoing revision and expansion, as will any future framework.",10/1/2010,8/2/2016 17:48,Nov-48,,1,15,,,Co-Creation,,,,,,,,,,,,Taylor and Francis+NEJM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, contrary to prior research that has underscored the merits of collaboration, we identify an optimal level of collaboration beyond which collaboration undermines both processes. Furthermore, the availability of internal resources can either complement or substitute for collaboration depending on the level of collaboration. In particular, we find that availability of internal resources mitigates the effect of academic collaboration on knowledge creation when collaboration is moderate and complements it as collaboration becomes excessive. Thus, our study reveals the contingent value of collaboration and the interplay between internal and network resources.

Marketing, strategy, and graphic design professionals have joined technical developers, business managers, and users in the development of Web-based applications. Often, these specialists work for different organizations with distinct histories and cultures. A longitudinal, qualitative field study of a Web-based application development project was undertaken to develop an in-depth understanding of the collaborative practices that unfold among diverse professionals on ISD projects. The paper proposes that multiparty collaborative practice can be understood as constituting a ""collective reflection-in-action"" cycle through which an information systems (IS) design emerges as a result of agents producing, sharing, and reflecting on explicit objects. Depending on their control over the various economic and cultural (intellectual) resources brought to the project and developed on the project, agents influence the design in distinctive ways. They use this control to either ""add to,"" ""ignore,"" or ""challenge"" the work produced by others. Which of these modes of collective reflection-in-action are enacted on the project influences whose expertise will be reflected in the final design. Implications for the study of boundary objects, multiparty collaboration, and organizational learning in contemporary ISD are drawn.",2005-06,11/19/2015 3:47,109+,,2,16,,,Collaborating on multiparty information systems development projects,,,,,,,English,,,Academic OneFile,,Gale,,109,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

VFH98B4P,book,2000,"Dixon, Nancy M.",Common Knowledge: How Companies Thrive by Sharing What They Know,,978-0-87584-904-1,,,,"From the Publisher:While external knowledge � about customers, about competitors � is critical, it rarely provides a competitive edge for companies because such information is equally available to everyone. But internal ""know-how"" that is unique to a specific company � how to introduce a new drug into the diabetes market, how to decrease assembly time in an automobile plant � is the stuff of which sustained competitive advantage is made. Nancy Dixon, an expert in the field of organizational learning, calls this knowledge borne of experience ""common knowledge,"" and argues that in order to get beyond talking about knowledge management to actually doing it, companies must first recognize that all knowledge is not created � and therefore can't be shared � equally. Creating successful knowledge transfer systems, Dixon argues, requires matching the type of knowledge to be shared to the method best suited for transferring it effectively. Based on an in-depth study of several organizations � including Ernst & Young, Bechtel, Ford, Chevron, British Petroleum, Texas Instruments, and the U.S. Army � that are leading the field in successful knowledge transfer, Common Knowledge reveals groundbreaking insights into how organizational knowledge is created, how it can be effectively shared and why transfer systems work when they do. Until now, most organizations have had to rely on costly ""trial and error"" to find a knowledge transfer system that works for them. Dixon helps managers take the guesswork out of this process by outlining three criteria that must be considered in order to determine how a transfer method will work in a specific situation: the type ofknowledge to be transferred, the nature of the task, and who the receiver of that knowledge will be. Drawing from the successful � but very different � ractices of the companies in her study and providing compelling illustrative stories based on the experiences of real managers, Dixon distills five distinct categories of knowledge transfer, explains the principles that make each of them work, and helps managers determine which of these systems would be most effective in their own organizations.Common Knowledge gets to the heart of one of the most difficult questions in knowledge transfer today: What makes a system work effectively in one organization but fail miserably in another? Going beyond ""one-size-fits-all"" approaches and simple generalities like upper management involvement and cultural issues, this important book will help organizations of every kind construct knowledge transfer systems tailored to their unique forms of ""common knowledge"" � and in the process create the best kind of competitive advantage there is: the kind that can't be copied.",2000,,,,,,,,Common Knowledge,,,,,Harvard Business School Press,"Boston, MA, USA",,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet, a theoretical account for the effects of the digital divide is currently lacking. This study examines three levels of the digital divide. The digital access divide (the first-level digital divide) is the inequality of access to information technology (IT) in homes and schools. The digital capability divide (the second-level digital divide) is the inequality of the capability to exploit IT arising from the first-level digital divide and other contextual factors. The digital outcome divide (the third-level digital divide) is the inequality of outcomes (e.g., learning and productivity) of exploiting IT arising from the second-level digital divide and other contextual factors. Drawing on social cognitive theory and computer self-efficacy literature, we developed a model to show how the digital access divide affects the digital capability divide and the digital outcome divide among students. The digital access divide focuses on computer ownership and usage in homes and schools. The digital capability divide and the digital outcome divide focus on computer self-efficacy and learning outcomes, respectively. This model was tested using data collected from over 4,000 students in Singapore. The results generate insights into the relationships among the three levels of the digital divide and provide a theoretical account for the effects of the digital divide. While school computing environments help to increase computer self-efficacy for all students, these factors do not eliminate knowledge the gap between students with and without home computers. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.",2011,2/29/2016 2:05,170-187,,1,22,,Information Systems Research,,,,,,,,,,,,,JSTOR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Contrary to the belief that these employees will leave before social ties can develop, constituent attachment was found to be the only significant predictor of turnover in 2 samples of front-line service workers in a casual dining, national restaurant chain after controlling for other aspects of work that can create a sense of attachment to a job, and other job attitudes, such as satisfaction and commitment. However, the effect was dependent on developmental life stage. Constituent attachment reduced turnover among workers classified as emerging adults, whereas constituent attachment did little to affect turnover among nonemerging adults. Implications of the results are discussed with respect to the value of considering segmentation in future research on turnover in the service sector and the use of life stage theory for understanding the leaving behavior of workers in different stages of adulthood.

Within this conception two specific themes stand out: first, fieldworkers increasingly understand and carry out their craft as an interpretive enterprise; second, fieldworkers have come to devote close attention to the actual practice of doing fieldwork. The materials in this book have been assembled with an eye toward furthering and consolidating these developments. To focus on processes of interpretation and practice is to move toward a more reflective, self-conscious stance toward the fieldwork enterprise. Self-consciousness emerges with the recognition that fieldwork itself is a social phenomenon, inescapably part of the very social worlds it seeks to discover, describe, and analyze. This recognition dispels any last vestiges of the belief that the fieldworker can somehow avoid or transcend the sorts of practical concerns and personal involvements that pervade everyday social life. Once the social character of the fieldworker is stressed, one is in a position to see more clearly the variety of personal, interactional, moral, and practical processes that lie at its core.}",,5/3/2016 1:06,,,,,,,Contemporary Field Research,,,,,{Waveland Press},,,,,,,CiteULike,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Control is defined as all attempts to motivate individuals to achieve desired objectives, and it can be exercised via formal and informal modes. Much of the previous research investigating the choice of control mode has focused on direct reporting relationships between IS project leaders and their superiors in a hierarchical setting. However, the client-IS relationships may take on a variety of forms, including both hierarchical and lateral settings. Moreover, prior research has found that the knowledge of the systems development process is a key antecedent of control, yet clients are unlikely to be as knowledgeable as IS professionals about this process. It is therefore unclear whether prior findings will generalize to the client-IS pair, and the goal of this research is to examine the exercise of control across this relationship. Data were gathered from a questionnaire survey of 69 pairs of clients and IS project leaders. The results are largely consistent with prior research on the antecedents of formal control modes, but they shed new insight on the choice of informal control modes.",2002,11/19/2015 3:20,484-498,,4,48,,Management Science,Controlling Information Systems Development Projects,,,,,,,,,,,,JSTOR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A central task in developing such theories is to uncover the generative mechanisms by which IT is implicated in organizational change processes, but to do so, we must explain how critical realism's concept of generative mechanisms applies in an IS context. Similarly, convincing arguments have been made for using Gibson's (1986) affordance theory from ecological psychology for developing theories of IT-associated organizational change, but this effort has been hampered due to insufficient attention to the ontological status of affordances. In this paper, we argue that affordances are the generative mechanisms we need to specify and explain how affordances are a specific type of generative mechanism. We use the core principles of critical realism to argue how affordances arise in the real domain from the relation between the complex assemblages of organizations and of IT artifacts, how affordances are actualized over time by organizational actors, and how these actualizations lead to the various effects we observe in the empirical domain. After presenting these arguments, we reanalyze two published cases in the literature, those of ACRO and Autoworks, to illustrate how affordance-based theories informed by critical realism enhance our ability to explain IT-associated organizational change. These examples show how researchers using this approach should proceed, and how managers can use these ideas to diagnose and address IT implementation problems.",2013-09,2/21/2016 18:48,819-834,,3,37,,MIS Quarterly,Critical Realism and Affordances,,,,,,,,,,,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The implicit assumption guiding CTC initiatives is that access to ICT will improve the life chances of the individuals who become involved in these centers. It is, however, prudent to empirically examine this assumption because the case for community technology interventions is somewhat weakened if the benefits of ICT use fail to accrue to those who are disadvantaged. Informed by Bourdieu's theory of reproduction, this study of a CTC initiative in an inner-city community explores the role of culture in reproducing digital inequality. Digital inequality reflects not only disparities in the structure of access to and use of ICT; it also reflects the ways in which longstanding social inequities shape beliefs and expectations regarding ICT and its impacts on life chances. While this initiative is considered successful in the sense that it provided access and basic computer literacy to residents lacking these resources, it represents a technology-centric fix to a problem that is deeply rooted in systemic patterns of spatial, political and economic disadvantage.",4/1/2006,2/18/2016 22:56,160-181,,2,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Taylor and Francis+NEJM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Through an in-depth qualitative case study of one of the largest China based IT service firms with diverse clients from Japan, the United States, and China, this research elaborates the cultural sensemaking activities of the supplier's individual employees. Specifically, drawing on the dynamic constructivist view of culture, this study develops the construct of ""cultural frames"" in the context of global IT outsourcing to characterize the knowledge structures guiding an individual's collaboration with diverse clients. A portfolio of cultural frames emerges and evolves through the individual's cultural sensemaking activities, which consist of the iterative enactment, alignment, and retention of cultural frames.

We call for research on skills that are needed by SCM data scientists and discuss how such skills and domain knowledge affect the effectiveness of an SCM data scientist. Such knowledge is crucial to develop future supply chain leaders. We propose definitions of data science and predictive analytics as applied to SCM. We examine possible applications of DPB in practice and provide examples of research questions from these applications, as well as examples of research questions employing DPB that stem from management theories.

As the speed of information growth exceeds Moore�s Law at the beginning of this new century, excessive data is making great troubles to human beings. However, there are so much potential and highly useful values hidden in the huge volume of data. A new scientific paradigm is born as data-intensive scientific discovery (DISD), also known as Big Data problems. A large number of fields and sectors, ranging from economic and business activities to public administration, from national security to scientific researches in many areas, involve with Big Data problems. On the one hand, Big Data is extremely valuable to produce productivity in businesses and evolutionary breakthroughs in scientific disciplines, which give us a lot of opportunities to make great progresses in many fields. There is no doubt that the future competitions in business productivity and technologies will surely converge into the Big Data explorations. On the other hand, Big Data also arises with many challenges, such as difficulties in data capture, data storage, data analysis and data visualization. This paper is aimed to demonstrate a close-up view about Big Data, including Big Data applications, Big Data opportunities and challenges, as well as the state-of-the-art techniques and technologies we currently adopt to deal with the Big Data problems. We also discuss several underlying methodologies to handle the data deluge, for example, granular computing, cloud computing, bio-inspired computing, and quantum computing.",8/10/2014,2/29/2016 4:10,314-347,,,275,,Information Sciences,"Data-intensive applications, challenges, techniques and technologies",,,,,,,,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this traditional model of ethnography, one of the most important data-gathering techniques is participant observation. The ethnographer observes and participates but does not actively seek to change the situation. In recent years, however, a new type of ethnographic research has emerged � one that can be called design ethnography. Design ethnography is where the researcher goes beyond observation and actively engages with people in the field. Our view is that design ethnography has much potential for research in information systems. It is a new form of engaged scholarship that bridges the gap between ethnographic research and design science research.",1/1/2015,2/13/2016 22:32,23-46,,1,25,,Info Systems J,,,,,,,,en,� 2014 Wiley Publishing Ltd,,,,Wiley Online Library,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To address this shortcoming, an action research study was embarked upon that develops and tests design principles for competence management systems. This research develops an integrative model of competence that not only outlines the interaction between organizational and individual level competence and the role of technology in this process, but also incorporates a typology of competence. Six Swedish organizations participated in this research project, which took 30 months and consisted of two action research cycles involving numerous data collection strategies and interventions such as prototypes. In addition to developing a set of design principles and considering their implications for both research and practice, this article includes a self-assessment of the study by evaluating it according to the criteria for canonical action research.",2004-09,7/19/2016 18:56,435-472,,3,28,,,Design Principles for Competence Management Systems,,,,,,,English,"Copyright University of Minnesota, MIS Research Center Sep 2004",,,,ProQuest,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we address this opportunity by (i) highlighting the potential of interviewing as a means of generating data that provides insight into people's experiential life; (ii) discussing the various epistemological stances that can be taken to interviewing; (iii) introducing and illustrating three interviewing methods (i.e., appreciative, laddering and photo-diary interviewing); and (iv) juxtaposing these methods to identify the conditions under which they are most effective.",2011-01,2/2/2016 21:24,16-Jan,,1,21,,Information and Organization,,,,,,,,,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This instrument is intended to be a tool for the study of the initial adoption and eventual diffusion of IT innovations within organizations. While the adoption of information technologies by individuals and organizations has been an area of substantial research interest since the early days of computerization, research efforts to date have led to mixed and inconclusive outcomes. The lack of a theoretical foundation for such research and inadequate definition and measurement of constructs have been identified as major causes for such outcomes. In a recent study examining the diffusion of new end-user IT, we decided to focus on measuring the potential adopters' perceptions of the technology. Measuring such perceptions has been termed a ``classic issue'' in the innovation diffusion literature, and a key to integrating the various findings of diffusion research. The perceptions of adopting were initially based on the five characteristics of innovations derived by Rogers (1983) from the diffusion of innovations literature, plus two developed specifically within this study. Of the existing scales for measuring these characteristics, very few had the requisite levels of validity and reliability. For this study, both newly created and existing items were placed in a common pool and subjected to four rounds of sorting by judges to establish which items should be in the various scales. The objective was to verify the convergent and discriminant validity of the scales by examining how the items were sorted into various construct categories. Analysis of interjudge agreement about item placement identified both bad items as well as weaknesses in some of the constructs' original definitions. These were subsequently redefined. Scales for the resulting constructs were subjected to three separate field tests. Following the final test, the scales all demonstrated acceptable levels of reliability. Their validity was further checked using factor analysis, as well as conducting discriminant analysis comparing responses between adopters and nonadopters of the innovation. The result is a parsimonious, 38-item instrument comprising eight scales which provides a useful tool for the study of the initial adoption and diffusion of innovations. A short, 25-item, version of the instrument is also suggested.",9/1/1991,9/16/2015 17:19,192-222,,3,2,,Information Systems Research,,,,,,,,,Copyright � 1991 INFORMS,,,,JSTOR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a study of 182 sales teams in a management consulting company, we find that sharing codified knowledge in the form of electronic documents saved time during the task, but did not improve work quality or signal competence to clients. In contrast, sharing personal advice improved work quality and signaled competence, but did not save time. Beyond the content of the knowledge, process costs in the form of document rework and lack of advisor effort negatively affected task outcomes. These findings dispute the claim that different types of knowledge are substitutes for each other, and provide a micro-foundation for understanding why and how a firm's knowledge capabilities translate into performance of knowledge work.

BPMZS9K7,book,2010,"Rogers, Everett M.","Diffusion of Innovations, 4th Edition",,978-1-4516-0247-0,,,,"Since the first edition of this landmark book was published in 1962, Everett Rogers's name has become ""virtually synonymous with the study of diffusion of innovations,"" according to Choice. The second and third editions of Diffusion of Innovations became the standard textbook and reference on diffusion studies. Now, in the fourth edition, Rogers presents the culmination of more than thirty years of research that will set a new standard for analysis and inquiry.The fourth edition is (1) a revision of the theoretical framework and the research evidence supporting this model of diffusion, and (2) a new intellectual venture, in that new concepts and new theoretical viewpoints are introduced. This edition differs from its predecessors in that it takes a much more critical stance in its review and synthesis of 5,000 diffusion publications. During the past thirty years or so, diffusion research has grown to be widely recognized, applied and admired, but it has also been subjected to both constructive and destructive criticism. This criticism is due in large part to the stereotyped and limited ways in which many diffusion scholars have defined the scope and method of their field of study. Rogers analyzes the limitations of previous diffusion studies, showing, for example, that the convergence model, by which participants create and share information to reach a mutual understanding, more accurately describes diffusion in most cases than the linear model. Rogers provides an entirely new set of case examples, from the Balinese Water Temple to Nintendo videogames, that beautifully illustrate his expansive research, as well as a completely revised bibliography covering all relevant diffusion scholarship in the past decade. Most important, he discusses recent research and current topics, including social marketing, forecasting the rate of adoption, technology transfer, and more. This all-inclusive work will be essential reading for scholars and students in the fields of communications, marketing, geography, economic development, political science, sociology, and other related fields for generations to come.",7/6/2010,,,550,,,,,,,,,,Simon and Schuster,,en,,,,,Google Books,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Latino and African American youth are just as likely as their white and Asian America counterparts to go online, manage a social networking site, and use a mobile phone. The shifting digital media practices of black and Latino youth raise crucial questions and suggest that producing a more equitable digital future requires more than access to technology. Even as black and Latino participation in the digital media world continues to evolve, we know little about the content or the context of their digital lives. One of the most urgent challenges regarding technology, diversity, and equity is the need to expand digital literacy. That is, the development of young people's capacity to not only access digital media but also use digital media in ways that are connected to the everyday lives and situations of youth and their communities. Finally, the article considers the extent to which Latino and African American engagement with digital media produces behaviors and learning outcomes that might impact the academic achievement gap.",5/1/2011,2/19/2016 3:49,12-Jan,,2,3,,International Journal of Learning and Media,Digital Divide,,,,,,,,,,,,MIT Press Journals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although organizational social media site (hereinafter SMS) implementations are proliferating, these technologies often do not harmoniously combine with traditional organizational cultures. To shed light on social media's impact on organizational life, this paper draws on an interpretive case study to investigate a global security company's efforts to implement a digitally enabled social network as part of a cultural change effort. Conceptually, based on the theory of IT�culture conflict, this paper underscores the interplay between organizational culture and technology. Our study finds that conflicts can arise between employees' workplace values and the values they ascribe to social media. This can result in an IT�culture system conflict, which organizations can address using policy-based, socialization-based and leadership-based mechanisms aimed at bringing cultural values and social media site values into alignment.",11/1/2013,12/7/2015 22:54,501-523,,6,23,,Info Systems J,Digitally enabling social networks,,,,,,,en,� 2013 Wiley Publishing Ltd,,,,Wiley Online Library,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast to earlier studies that take online user reviews as an exogenous factor, we consider reviews both influencing and influenced by movie sales. The consideration of the endogenous nature of online user reviews significantly changes the analysis. Our result shows that the rating of online user reviews has no significant impact on movies' box office revenues after accounting for the endogeneity, indicating that online user reviews have little persuasive effect on consumer purchase decisions. Nevertheless, we find that box office sales are significantly influenced by the volume of online posting, suggesting the importance of awareness effect. The finding of awareness effect for online user reviews is surprising as online reviews under the analysis are posted to the same website and are not expected to increase product awareness. We attribute the effect to online user reviews as an indicator of the intensity of underlying word-of-mouth that plays a dominant role in driving box office revenues.",2008-11,9/30/2015 20:28,1007-1016,,4,45,,Decision Support Systems,Do online reviews matter?,Information Technology and Systems in the Internet-Era,,,,,,,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study was done between December 2000 and June 2002. Among the consequences considered was children's academic performance. Participants were 140 children, mostly African American (83%), mostly boys (58%), and most living in single-parent households (75%) in which the median annual income was $15,000 (U.S. dollars) or less. Average age was 13.8 years. Ages ranged between 10 and 18 years, Internet use was continuously recorded, and multiple measures of academic performance were obtained during the 16-month trial. Findings indicated that children who used the Internet more had higher scores on standardized tests of reading achievement and higher grade point averages 6 months, 1 year, and 16 months later than did children who used it less. Older children used the Internet more than did younger children, but age had no effect on the nature or the academic performance benefits of Internet use.

The current paper extends this earlier contribution, with a widened scope of all interpretive research in IS, and through further material on carrying out fieldwork, using theory and analysing data. In addition, new topics are discussed on constructing and justifying a research contribution, and on ethical issues and tensions in the conduct of interpretive work. The primary target audience for the paper is less-experienced IS researchers, but I hope that the paper will also stimulate reflection for the more-experienced IS researcher and be of relevance to interpretive researchers in other social science fields.",2006-06,5/3/2016 0:29,320-330,,3,15,,,,,,,,,,English,� Palgrave Macmillan Ltd 2006,,,,ProQuest,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent models help to articulate the potentially different explanations for why some users will adopt and then continue using new technologies, but these models have not explicitly incorporated IT knowledge. This is particularly important in contexts where the user base may be non-IT professionals�i.e., the users may vary substantially in their basic IT knowledge. We draw on psychology to argue that in situations where there is a wide variance in actual IT knowledge, there will often exist a U-shaped relationship between actual and self-perceived IT knowledge such that the least knowledgeable believe themselves to be highly knowledgeable. We then draw on individual-level adoption theories to argue that users with high self-perceived IT knowledge will be more likely to adopt new technologies and do so faster. We also draw on individual-level continuance theories to argue that users with low actual IT knowledge will be more likely to discontinue using new technologies and do so faster. We test our expectations using a proprietary data set of 225 sales professionals in a large Indian pharmaceutical company that is testing a new customer relationship management system.

Using a broad historical analysis, it investigates ideas and visions about the future that are increasingly evoked to support arguments about the imminent demise of the dominant modern educational model. Focusing neither on prediction nor prescription, this text suggests the goal is an analysis of the ways in which the notion of the future circulates in contemporary discourse. Five specific discourses are explored: globalisation; new information and communications technologies; feminist; indigenous; and spiritual. The book demonstrates the connections between particular approaches to time, visions of the future, and educational visions and practices. The author asserts that every approach to educational change is inherently based on an underlying image of the future.",5/19/2005,,,211,,,,,Educational Futures,,,,,Routledge,,en,,,,,Google Books,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Disparate and often conflicting theoretical models have been used to explain how these communities respond to this tension. We conducted a case study of how one online coproduction community�the nine-year history of the Wikipedia article on autism�handles this tension. We find that the nature of the change�retain tension and the community�s response to it fluctuates considerably over the life of the community. These changes bear striking similarities to processes associated with traditional software development life cycles, despite the absence of traditional control mechanisms. What initially appear to be conflicts in the extant literature actually describe different roles and production focus at the different stages of development. Disruptive events signal the need for the community to shift production focus, which often involves members joining and leaving the production process, rather than adopting new roles.

The current research focuses within a discourse, and within a lingua franca for communication, and attempts to assess whether emoticon use varies as a function of user-type within the online context.  The online context is a web user-forum associated with a software technology company.  The user categories are determined by a few orthogonal classifications: employees, novice users, and experts; recipients of kudos vs. non-recipients of kudos; etc.  As part of a developing theory of presentation of ``professional'' selves, and perceptions thereof, we test the hypotheses that kudo recipients deploy markedly fewer negative emoticons than comparison categories and that non-employee experts use markedly more emoticons in general than other categories of forum users.

This view predicts that firms tend to decentralize IT governance in more uncertain environments. We investigate this issue by studying the relationship between environmental uncertainty and IT infrastructure governance in a sample of business units from Fortune 1000 companies. The key proposition in this paper is that the relationship between environmental uncertainty and decentralization in IT infrastructure governance is best characterized as a curvilinear relationship. That is, when environmental uncertainty increases from low to high, firms tend to first decentralize their IT infrastructure decisions to the business units to enhance their responsiveness; and then centralize their IT infrastructure decisions to the headquarters as uncertainty increases further, to achieve the benefits of coordination and to mitigate the potential agency problem in uncertain environments. Moreover, the study proposes that business unrelatedness between business units and their headquarters moderates the curvilinear relationship between environmental uncertainty and IT infrastructure governance. We find that both the propositions are supported by the data.",3/1/2010,11/30/2015 5:44,389-399,,2,22,,Information Systems Research,Environmental Uncertainty and IT Infrastructure Governance,,,,,,,,,,,,pubsonline.informs.org.ezproxy.baylor.edu (Atypon),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, universities have turned to ERP as a means of replacing existing management and administration computer systems. This article provides analysis of the rollout of an ERP system in one particular institution in the UK, the particular focus being on how the development, implementation and use of both generic and university specific functionality is mediated and shaped by a fundamental and long standing tension within universities: this is the extent to which higher education institutions are organisations much like any other and the extent to which they are ""unique"". The aim of this article is not to attempt to settle this issue of similarity/difference in one way or another. Rather, it seeks to illustrate the value of taking discussions of similarity relationships surrounding the university and other organisations as the topic of analysis. One way of working with these kinds of issues without resolving them is to consider their ""distribution"" and where ERP shifts the responsibility for their final resolution. This is a novel and insightful way of understanding how ERP systems are refashioning the identity of universities. The article suggests, moreover, that ERP software is ""accompanied"" by such tensions in which ever site it is implemented. The research presented here is based on a participant observation study carried over the period of three years.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",2004,9/24/2015 21:43,31-52,,1,17,,,,,,,,,,English,Copyright MCB UP Limited (MCB) 2004,,,,ProQuest,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The model highlights areas where active management has potential to enhance the capabilities of a firm for sustained innovation of its business processes.

While the framework and criteria have general applicability, my focus is the evaluation of theories within the information systems discipline. To illustrate the usefulness of the framework and criteria, I show how they can be employed to pinpoint the strengths and weaknesses of a theory which, based upon citation evidence, has had a significant impact on other researchers within the information systems discipline. Because the evaluation of existing theories often provides the basis for refining existing theories or building new theories, I also show how the framework and criteria can be used to inform the development of high-quality theory.

Drawing from social network and technology use literature, we examine how the structure of a team's advice-seeking network affects individual use of a newly implemented information technology. We develop cross-level hypotheses related to the effects of the structure of mutually interconnected ties within the team (i.e., internal closure) as well as the structure of nonredundant ties outside the team boundaries (i.e., external bridging). The hypotheses are tested in a field study of 265 employees working in 44 teams in a large financial services institution. Results show that internal closure has a U-shaped effect on individual use such that individual usage of the system is higher when the number of internal advice-seeking ties within the team is low or high, suggesting that medium levels of internal closure are the least desirable network configurations because in such instances teams neither realize the benefits of high closure information sharing nor are they able to avoid in-group biases associated with low closure conditions. Our results also reveal that in addition to having a direct positive effect on individual use, external bridging interacts with internal closure in a complex manner. The U-shaped effect of closure is dominant when bridging is high but assumes an inverted U-shaped pattern when bridging is low. Several implications for managers follow from these findings. First, in order to increase usage of technology, in teams characterized by low internal closure, managers should encourage the development of ties across team boundaries. Second, managers should maximize within-team interconnections in order to facilitate the circulation of external knowledge within team boundaries. Finally, managers should be aware that maximizing internal closure by facilitating interconnections among team members could be dangerous if not accompanied by mechanisms for external bridging.",12/1/2012,10/26/2015 20:31,Sep-42,,3,29,,,Everybody Needs Somebody,,,,,,,,,,,,Taylor and Francis+NEJM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted an extensive longitudinal field study to gain an understanding of the interplay between technology and patterns of clinical work embodied in routines. We use the analytical device of narrative networks to identify where and how HIT influences patterns of work. We further draw upon adaptive structuration theory to conceptualize HIT as an intervention that alters the flow of events in a narrative network. Our findings suggest that the key to successful implementation is to manage the co-evolution process between routines and HIT and to actively orchestrate a virtuous cycle through agentic action. We propose a dynamic process model of adaptive routinization of HIT that delineates the major channels through which HIT and routines interact, identifies the different stages in the dynamic co-evolution process, and isolates the pivotal role of two forms of agency in enabling the virtuous cycle of co-evolution.

Using research on information processing as a foundation, we suggest that in the context of an online community, reviewer disclosure of identity-descriptive information is used by consumers to supplement or replace product information when making purchase decisions and evaluating the helpfulness of online reviews. Using a unique data set based on both chronologically compiled ratings as well as reviewer characteristics for a given set of products and geographical location-based purchasing behavior from Amazon, we provide evidence that community norms are an antecedent to reviewer disclosure of identity-descriptive information. Online community members rate reviews containing identity-descriptive information more positively, and the prevalence of reviewer disclosure of identity information is associated with increases in subsequent online product sales. In addition, we show that shared geographical location increases the relationship between disclosure and product sales, thus highlighting the important role of geography in electronic commerce. Taken together, our results suggest that identity-relevant information about reviewers shapes community members' judgment of products and reviews. Implications for research on the relationship between online word-of-mouth (WOM) and sales, peer recognition and reputation systems, and conformity to online community norms are discussed.",9/1/2008,9/30/2015 20:22,291-313,,3,19,,Information Systems Research,Examining the Relationship Between Reviews and Sales,,,,,,,,,,,,pubsonline.informs.org (Atypon),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, there is scant research on the potential of organizational culture, and specifically subcultures to influence the strategic alignment of IS and organizations. Second, there is a dearth of literature that considers the relationship between alignment and implementation success. In this paper, we address both of these gaps by considering the influence of organizational subcultures on the alignment of a specific IS�a knowledge management system (KMS)�with organizational strategy. Our analysis demonstrates the important roles played by three different subcultures�enhancing, countercultural, and chameleon�in the alignment of the KMS. The analysis also underscores the complementary nature of the alignment and implementation literatures and suggests that they should be used in concert to explain the success of an IS. Drawing on our analysis, we build a subculture model, which depicts the intersection of alignment and implementation. From a managerial perspective, the subculture model highlights three different approaches to managing alignment and implementation. From a theoretical perspective, our paper highlights the need for IS alignment models to be modified, so that subunit-level analyses are incorporated. It also illustrates that organizations confront challenges of alignment and implementation simultaneously rather than sequentially.",6/12/2009,12/7/2015 22:48,39-59,,1,22,,Information Systems Research,Examining the Strategic Alignment and Implementation Success of a KMS,,,,,,,,,,,,pubsonline.informs.org.ezproxy.baylor.edu (Atypon),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that both of these system quality constructs significantly predict the extent to which users place trust in mobile commerce technologies. Second, our study considers the effect of culture by comparing the trust of French and American potential users in m-commerce technologies.

Q2BKFI7G,journalArticle,2008,"Dibbern, Jens; Winkler, Jessica; Heinzl, Armin",Explaining Variations in Client Extra Costs Between Software Projects Offshored to India,MIS Q.,,0276-7783,,http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2017366.2017373,"Gaining economic benefits from substantially lower labor costs has been reported as a major reason for offshoring labor-intensive information systems services to low-wage countries. However, if wage differences are so high, why is there such a high level of variation in the economic success between offshored IS projects? This study argues that offshore outsourcing involves a number of extra costs for the client organization that account for the economic failure of offshore projects. The objective is to disaggregate these extra costs into their constituent parts and to explain why they differ between offshored software projects. The focus is on software development and maintenance projects that are offshored to Indian vendors. A theoretical framework is developed a priori based on transaction cost economics (TCE) and the knowledge-based view of the firm, complemented by factors that acknowledge the specific offshore context. The framework is empirically explored using a multiple case study design including six offshored software projects in a large German financial service institution. The results of our analysis indicate that the client incurs post- contractual extra costs for four types of activities: (1) requirements specification and design, (2) knowledge transfer, (3) control, and (4) coordination. In projects that require a high level of client-specific knowledge about idiosyncratic business processes and software systems, these extra costs were found to be substantially higher than in projects where more general knowledge was needed. Notably, these costs most often arose independently from the threat of opportunistic behavior, challenging the predominant TCE logic of market failure. Rather, the client extra costs were particularly high in client-specific projects because the effort for managing the consequences of the knowledge asymmetries between client and vendor was particularly high in these projects. Prior experiences of the vendor with related client projects were found to reduce the level of extra costs but could not fully offset the increase in extra costs in highly client-specific projects. Moreover, cultural and geographic distance between client and vendor as well as personnel turnover were found to increase client extra costs. Slight evidence was found, however, that the cost-increasing impact of these factors was also leveraged in projects with a high level of required client-specific knowledge (moderator effect).",2008-06,2/9/2016 19:20,333�366,,2,32,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The original essays in Explorations in Economic Sociology represent the most important work in this renewed field and employ a rich variety of research methods�theoretical, ethnographic, and historical�to illustrate its key concerns. Explorations in Economic Sociology forges innovative social theories of such economic institutions as money, markets, and industry. Although traditional economists have identified markets as driven solely by the forces of supply and demand, social factors frequently intervene. Sales at auction are determined not simply by a seller's personal knowledge of customers. Shareholder attitudes and employee organization influence everything from the way firms borrow money to the way corporate performance is measured.�Firms themselves operate in social networks in which trust is a crucial factor in settling the terms for cooperation or competition. Throughout the essays in this volume, the contributors point the way to developing a more healthy economy by fostering productive industrial networks, avoiding disintegration at management levels, and anticipating the consequences of the shift from manufacturing to service industries. Explorations in Economic Sociology is a pioneering work that bridges the gap between social theory and economic analysis and demonstrates the importance of this union in achieving an effective understanding of economic issues. The book should stimulate new interest in economic sociology by bringing together many of its most fundamental voices.",8/19/1993,,,477,,,,,,,,,,Russell Sage Foundation,,en,,,,,Google Books,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Findings show that a multiple-contingencies approach: 1. provides additional information about patterns of design in work units, 2. isolates instances in which equifinality could be observed, and 3. gives further insight into the phenomenon of misfit.

Holiday selection neither happens in a vacuum, nor is it exclusively based on online holiday reviews. In order to gain a holistic and realistic understanding one needs to consider: the concurrent influence of other, more conventional, holiday content elements (e.g. photos, textual descriptions), as well as the relevant cognitive mechanisms for processing this kind of information. With the aid of a purposively developed navigation prototype, respondents were subjected to a variety of holiday representations. Surprisingly early in the research process the ensuing observation and questioning unveiled fairly consistent patterns of content processing and decision-making. This explorative-qualitative study suggests that online reviews play a secondary, complementary role to holiday selection and that they are subjected to a set of heuristics before being adopted and utilised.",2011-04,9/30/2015 20:40,215-224,,2,32,,Tourism Management,Exploring the adoption and processing of online holiday reviews,,,,,,,,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper presents findings from a study which investigated the influence of several factors on the social dimension of alignment within 10 business units in the Canadian life insurance industry. The social dimension of alignment refers to the state in which business and IT executives understand and are committed to the business and IT mission, objectives, and plans. The research model included four factors that would potentially influence alignment: (1) shared domain knowledge between business and IT executives, (2) IT implementation success, (3) communication between business and IT executives, and (4) connections between business and IT planning processes. The outcome, alignment, was operationalized in two ways: the degree of mutual understanding of current objectives (short-term alignment) and the congruence of IT vision (long-term alignment) between business and IT executives. A total of 57 semi-structured interviews were held with 45 informants. Written business and IT strategic plans, minutes from IT steering committee meetings, and other strategy documents were collected and analyzed from each of the 10 business units. All four factors in the model (shared domain knowledge, IT implementation success, communication between business and IT executives, and connections between business and IT planning) were found to influence short-term alignment. Only shared domain knowledge was found to influence long-term alignment. A new factor, strategic business plans, was found to influence both short and long-term alignment. The findings suggest that both practitioners and researchers should direct significant effort toward understanding shared domain knowledge, the factor which had the strongest influence on the alignment between IT and business executives. There is also a call for further research into the creation of an IT vision.",3/1/2000,10/23/2015 18:04,81-113,,1,24,,MIS Quarterly,,,,,,,,,"Copyright � 2000 Management Information Systems Research Center, University of Minnesota",,,,JSTOR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Third parties can be either shared or unshared. Shared third parties signal insider status and have a predictable positive effect on knowledge transfer. Unshared third parties, however, signal outsider status and are believed to undermine knowledge transfer. Surprisingly, unshared third parties have been ignored in empirical analysis, and so we do not know if or how much unshared third parties contribute to the process. Using knowledge transfer data from an online technical forum, we illustrate how unshared third parties affect the rate at which individuals initiate and sustain knowledge transfer relationships. Empirical results indicate that unshared third parties undermine knowledge sharing, and they also indicate that the magnitude of the negative unshared-third-party effect declines the more unshared third parties overlap in what they know. Our results provide a more complete view of how third parties contribute to knowledge sharing. The results also advance our understanding of network-based dynamics defined more broadly. By documenting how knowledge overlap among unshared third parties moderates their negative influence, our results show when the benefits provided by third parties and by bridges (i.e., relationships with outsiders) will be opposed versus when both can be enjoyed.",5/20/2015,8/4/2016 1:41,1400-1414,,5,26,,Organization Science,Forgotten Third Parties,,,,,,,,,,,,pubsonline.informs.org (Atypon),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper sets out the findings of a major review of the sets of factors that are available and outlines the main reservations that have been expressed about the approach. It then shows how a systems model, the Formal Systems Model, can be used as a framing device to deliver the benefits of taking account of �critical success factors� whilst at the same time avoiding the problems associated with �critical success factors� that give rise to the criticisms. Two IS projects are used to demonstrate use of this framing devise. When observation began at the start of the projects they looked very similar and equally likely to succeed. In the event, one of the projects was largely successful across the whole of the range of measures normally used to judge success whilst the other exhibited most of the characteristics of failure. Analysis using the framing device is well able to demonstrate the marked differences in the ways the two projects were managed and to account for stark contrast in the levels of success achieved. The paper concludes that the Formal System Model allows the underlying benefits of �critical success factors� to be secured whilst overcoming most of the problems associated with a checklist approach.",2006-01,5/1/2016 0:46,53-65,,1,24,,International Journal of Project Management,,,,,,,,,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Quality is positioned as a complex generic concept while access and success are identified as key concepts in the social inclusion domain, supplemented by the concept of participation. The topic is approached through an integrative analysis of the theory and practice literature on social inclusion in higher education. After contextualising current higher education within economic globalisation, the notion of quality is uncoupled from the necessity of a neoliberal framing allowing broader interpretations arising from more inclusive ideologies. Access, participation and success are shown to represent degrees of social inclusion underpinned by a nested spectrum of ideologies � neoliberalism, social justice and human potential, respectively � with human potential ideology offering the most embracing perspective.

Being neither capricious nor frivolous, human social behavior can best be described as following along lines of more or less well-formulated plans. Before attending a concert, for example, a person may extend an invitation to a date, purchase tickets, change into proper attire, call a cab, collect the date, and proceed to the concert hall. Most, if not all, of these activities will have been designed in advance; their execution occurs as the plan unfolds. To be sure, a certain sequence of actions can become so habitual or routine that it is performed almost automatically, as in the case of driving from home to work or playing the piano. Highly developed skills of this kind typically no longer require conscious formulation of a behavioral plan. Nevertheless, at least in general outline, we are normally well aware of the actions required to attain a certain goal. Consider such a relatively routine behavior as typing a letter. When setting this activity as a goal, we anticipate the need to locate a typewriter, insert a sheet of paper, adjust the margins, formulate words and sentences, strike the appropriate keys, and so forth. Some parts of the plan are more routine, and require less conscious thought than others, but without an explicit or implicit plan to guide the required sequence of acts, no letter would get typed.",1985,4/14/2016 0:46,,,,,,,From Intentions to Actions,SSSP Springer Series in Social Psychology,,,,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,,en,�1985 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg,,,,link.springer.com,,DOI: 10.1007/978-3-642-69746-3_2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we conduct a close examination of vendor strategy and practices in one long-term successful applications management outsourcing engagement. Our analysis indicates that the vendor's efficiency was based on the economic benefits derived from the ability to develop a complementary set of core competencies. This ability, in turn, was based on the centralization of decision rights from a variety and multitude of IT projects controlled by the vendor.

After reviewing data on Internet penetration, we describe five dimensions of digital inequality --- in equipment, autonomy of use, skill, social support, and the purposes for which the technology is employed -- that we believe deserve additional attention. In each case, we develop hypotheses to guide research, with the goal of developing a testable model of the relationship between individual characteristics, dimensions of inequality, and positive outcomes of technology use. Finally, because the rapidity of organizational as well as technical change means that we cannot presume that current patterns of inequality will persist into the future, we call on students of digital inequality to study institutional issues in order to understand patterns of inequality as evolving consequences of interactions among firms� strategic choices, consumers� responses, and government policies.",2004,,355-400,,,,,,From Unequal Access to Differentiated Use,,,,,,,,,,,,CiteULike,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The technology acceptance model (TAM) has been widely studied in IS research as an explanation of the use of information systems across IS types and nationalities. While this line of research has found significant cross-cultural differences, it has ignored the effects of gender, even though in socio-linguistic research, gender is a fundamental aspect of culture. Indeed, socio-linguistic research has shown that men tend to focus discourse on hierarchy and independence, while women focus on intimacy and solidarity. This literature provides a solid grounding for conceptual extensions to the IT diffusion research and the technology acceptance model. Testing gender differences that might relate to beliefs and use of computer-based media, this study sampled 392 female and male responses via a cross-sectional survey instrument. The sample drew from comparable groups of knowledge workers using e-mail systems in the airline industry in North America, Asia, and Europe. Study findings indicate that women and men differ in their perceptions but not use of e-mail. These findings suggest that researchers should include gender in IT diffusion models along with other cultural effects. Managers and co-workers, moreover, need to realize that the same mode of communication may be perceived differently by the sexes, suggesting that more favorable communications environments might be created, environments that take into account not only organizational contextual factors, but also the gender of users. The creation of these environments involves not only the actual deployment of communication media, but also organizational training on communications media.",12/1/1997,10/23/2015 18:19,389-400,,4,21,,MIS Quarterly,Gender Differences in the Perception and Use of E-Mail,,,,,,,,"Copyright � 1997 Management Information Systems Research Center, University of Minnesota",,,,JSTOR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, prior work has typically examined this phenomenon considering only one geographic unit�country, state, or metropolitan area�at a time and has rarely accounted for spatial distance. We disentangle these multiple effects by using a regression framework employing choice-based sampling to estimate the likelihood of citation between random patents. We find both country and state borders to have independent effects on knowledge diffusion beyond what just geographic proximity in the form of metropolitan collocation or shorter within-region distances can explain. An identification methodology comparing inventor-added and examiner-added citation patterns points to an even stronger role of political borders. The puzzling state border effect remains robust on average across analyses, though it is found to have waned with time. The country effect has, in contrast, not only remained robust but even strengthened over time.

Our research suggests that there are four major challenges associated with successfully integrating an online user community into an organization's innovation processes: understanding the ideas posted, identifying the best ideas, balancing the needs of transparency with the community against disclosure to competitors, and sustaining the community. In this article, we analyze specific aspects of these four challenges that became evident during the first 18 months of Dell IdeaStorm, Dell Computer Corporation's online user innovation community. We describe the recommendations that we initially posted on Dell's site for improving IdeaStorm and the responses we received. The article concludes with seven recommendations for how to overcome these challenges, which we believe can be used by other firms to leverage user innovation communities using an open model with social media tools.",2010-12,5/4/2016 21:47,213-228,,4,9,,MIS Quarterly Executive,Getting Customers' Ideas to Work for You,,,,,,,,,,,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is an apparent contradiction: on the one hand, we are told of the diversity of specific organizational contexts and on the other, we often find the same standardized software solutions being applied across those settings. How do generic software packages work in so many different contexts? Science and Technology Studies provides contrasting accounts of how this contradiction is resolved: either stressing the unwanted organizational change that standardized systems may bring; or, alternatively, insisting these technologies can only be made to work through processes of 'localization'. We argue that the focus on specificity versus localization of application contexts draws attention away from enquiring into the origins and characteristics of generic solutions. Through comparing the design and evolution of two software packages we shift the debate from understanding how technologies are made to work within particular settings to how they are built to work across a diverse range of organizational contexts. Our question is 'How do software packages achieve the mobility that allows them to bridge the heterogeneity within organizations and between organizations in different sectors and cultures?' We describe a set of revealed strategies through which suppliers produce software that embodies characteristics common across many users; what we term generification work. One aspect of this process of generification is the configuring of users within 'managed communities', but it also includes 'smoothing' the contents of the package and, at times, reverting to 'social authority'. Our argument is that generic systems do exist but that they are brought into being through an intricately managed process, involving the broader extension of a particularized software application and, at the same time, the management of the user community attached to that solution.",4/1/2007,9/24/2015 21:54,254-280,,2,37,,Social Studies of Science,Global Software and Its Provenance,,,,,,,,"Copyright � 2007 Sage Publications, Ltd.",,,,JSTOR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Pareto principle, also known as the 80/20 rule, describes this common pattern of sales concentration. However, information technology in general and Internet markets in particular have the potential to substantially increase the collective share of niche products, thereby creating a longer tail in the distribution of sales. This paper investigates the Internet's �long tail� phenomenon. By analyzing data collected from a multichannel retailer, it provides empirical evidence that the Internet channel exhibits a significantly less concentrated sales distribution when compared with traditional channels. Previous explanations for this result have focused on differences in product availability between channels. However, we demonstrate that the result survives even when the Internet and traditional channels share exactly the same product availability and prices. Instead, we find that consumers' usage of Internet search and discovery tools, such as recommendation engines, are associated with an increase the share of niche products. We conclude that the Internet's long tail is not solely due to the increase in product selection but may also partly reflect lower search costs on the Internet. If the relationships we uncover persist, the underlying trends in technology portend an ongoing shift in the distribution of product sales.

A significant constraint on the effectiveness of such systems is that they assume workers know what knowledge they need (they know what they don't know) when, in fact, they often do not know what knowledge they need (they don't know what they don't know). A way to overcome this problem is to use visual ontologies to help users learn relevant concepts and relationships in the knowledge domain, enabling them to search the knowledge base in a more educated manner. However, no guidelines exist for designing such ontologies. To fill this gap, we draw on theories of philosophical ontology and cognition to propose guidelines for designing visual ontologies for knowledge identification.We conducted three experiments to compare the effectiveness of guided ontologies, visual ontologies that followed our guidelines, to unguided ontologies, visual ontologies that violated our guidelines. We found that subjects performed considerably better with the guided ontologies, and that subjects could perceive the benefits of using guided ontologies, at least in some circumstances. On the basis of these results, we conclude that the way visual ontologies are presented makes a difference in knowledge identification and that theories of philosophical ontology and cognition can guide the construction of more effective visual representations. Furthermore, we propose that the principles we used to create the guided visual ontologies can be generalized for other cases where visual models are used to inform users about application domains.",2011-12,5/8/2016 18:48,883-A11,,4,35,,MIS Quarterly,,,,,,,,,,,,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there is no consensus about what hard and soft news exactly is, or how it should be defined or measured. Moreover, the concept has not been clearly differentiated from or systematically related to concepts addressing very similar phenomena � tabloidization and �infotainment�. Consequently, the results of various studies are hard to compare and different scientific discourses on related issues remain unconnected. Against this backdrop, this article offers a conceptual analysis of the concept based on studies in English and other languages. We identify key dimensions of the concept and make suggestions for a standardized definition and multi-dimensional measurement of harder and softer news. In doing so, we propose to distinguish thematic, focus and style features as basic dimensions that � in their combination � make up harder and softer types of news.",11/11/2011,8/2/2016 19:27,1464880000000000,,,,,Journalism,Hard and soft news,,,,,,,en,,,,,jou.sagepub.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Survey data from high technology companies in China demonstrate that the effects of knowledge breadth and depth are contingent on market knowledge acquisition and knowledge sharing in opposite ways. In particular, a firm with a broad knowledge base is more likely to achieve radical innovation in the presence of internal knowledge sharing rather than market knowledge acquisition. In contrast, a firm with a deep knowledge base is more capable of developing radical innovation through market knowledge acquisition rather than internal knowledge sharing.

Compared with the prevailing proprietary approaches, open-source software products are developed by co-opting external developers and prospective users. Although a core group of developers might still play a key role in the initial design and development, a notable aspect of the open-source software paradigm is the role of peripheral developers in the enhancement and popularization of the product. Peripheral developers are not formal members of the core development team. They voluntarily contribute their time and creative talent in improving the quality of the product or in popularizing the product through word-of-mouth advocacy. As volunteers, they are not subject to the traditional hierarchical controls, nor are they contractually obligated. Peripheral developers represent a novel and unique aspect of open-source software development, and there is a greater interest in tapping their potential. However, there has been limited evidence about how and when their participation has beneficial impacts. We examine how peripheral developers contribute to product quality and diffusion by utilizing longitudinal data on 147 open-source software products. Hierarchical linear modeling analysis indicates that peripheral developers make significant contributions to product quality and diffusion, especially on projects that are in the more mature stages of product development.",11/18/2010,11/30/2015 2:23,144-163,,1,23,,Information Systems Research,,,,,,,,,,,,,pubsonline.informs.org.ezproxy.baylor.edu (Atypon),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If users do not comply with IS security policies, security solutions lose their efficacy. Of the different IS security policy compliance approaches, training is the most commonly suggested in the literature. Yet, few of the existing studies about training to promote IS policy compliance utilize theory to explain what learning principles affect user compliance with IS security policies, or offer empirical evidence of their practical effectiveness. Consequently, there is a need for IS security training approaches that are theory-based and empirically evaluated. Accordingly, we propose a training program based on two theories: the universal constructive instructional theory and the elaboration likelihood model. We then validate the training program for IS security policy compliance training through an action research project. The action research intervention suggests that the theory-based training achieved positive results and was practical to deploy. Moreover, the intervention suggests that information security training should utilize contents and methods that activate and motivate the learners to systematic cognitive processing of information they receive during the training. In addition, the action research study made clear that a continuous communication process was also required to improve user IS security policy compliance. The findings of this study offer new insights for scholars and practitioners involved in IS security policy compliance.",2010-12,7/19/2016 19:00,767-A4,,4,34,,MIS Quarterly,Improving Employees' Compliance Through Information Systems Security Training,,,,,,,,,,,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I ground this perspective in an empirical study which examined the use of a new information technology within one organization over a two-year periods. In this organization, a series of subtle but nonetheless significant changes were enacted over time as organizational actors appropriated the new technology into their work practices, and then experimented with local innovations, responded to unanticipated breakdowns and contingencies, initiated opportunistic shifts in structure and coordination mechanisms, and improvised various procedural, cognitive, and normative variations to accommodate their evolving use of the technology. These findings provide the empirical basis for a practice-based perspective on organizational transformation. Because it is grounded in the micro-level changes that actors enact over time as they make sense of and act in the world, a practice lens can avoid the strong assumptions of rationality, determinism, or discontinuity characterizing existing change perspectives. A situated change perspective may offer a particularly useful strategy for analyzing change in organizations turning increasingly away from patterns of stability, bureaucracy, and control to those of flexibility, self-organizing, and learning.",1996-03,9/29/2015 2:23,63-92,,1,7,,Information Systems Research,Improvising Organizational Transformation Over Time,,,,,,,,,,,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we take a broader approach to the issue, combining a ""productivity"" and an ""adoption"" approach, while including a search for contextual variables in the firm's strategy that affects complementarity. Analysis of contextual variables is not only interesting per se, but also improves the productivity test for the existence of complementarity. We use our empirical methodology to analyze complementarity between innovation activities: internal research and development (R&D) and external knowledge acquisition. Our results suggest that internal R&D and external knowledge acquisition are complementary innovation activities, but that the degree of complementarity is sensitive to other elements of the firm's strategic environment. We identify reliance on basic R&D; the importance of universities and research centers as an information source for the innovation process; as an important contextual variable affecting complementarity between internal and external innovation activities.

In this study, we explore the design of optimal incentive systems that induce task-related effort, helping, and knowledge sharing within workgroups. We identify three distinct types of employee linkages that must be accommodated in the design of effective incentive systems: (1) outcome linkages, whereby the outcome of one employee's task is influenced by that of another; (2) help linkages, whereby each employee can directly expend effort on helping another; and (3) knowledge linkages, whereby each employee can share job-related knowledge with another. We analytically investigate the effect of each type of employee linkage, and some combinations of these linkages, on the optimal design of incentive systems. Our analytical results demonstrate how, by optimally weighting individual-level and workgroup-level incentives, managers can balance the need to induce cooperation and coordination among employees with the need to manage employees' incentive-related risk. Counter to conventional wisdom, we also demonstrate that both group and individual incentives are necessary to facilitate cooperative behaviors such as knowledge sharing in workgroups. Further, we empirically test some of the insights developed from the analytical models; our empirical findings support these analytical results.",8/20/2007,7/24/2016 3:03,1533-1550,,10,53,,Management Science,,,,,,,,,,,,,pubsonline.informs.org (Atypon),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specifically, we examine how an industry's productivity is affected by the IT capital stock of its suppliers. These supplier-driven IT spillovers occur because, due to competition in the supplying industry, quality benefits from suppliers' IT investments can pass downstream. If the output deflators of supplying industries (consequently the intermediate input deflator of the using industries) do not capture the quality improvement from IT, then the output productivity of the supplying industries is mismeasured or misassigned. We develop and empirically test a model capturing these supplier-driven effects using data on 85 manufacturing industries at the three-digit SIC code level. We find that for a 10.5% increase in suppliers' IT capital, the suppliers' output increases by 0.63%-0.70%, which is more than covering the cost of the increase in suppliers' IT capital. In addition, this increase in suppliers' IT capital increases the average downstream industry's output by $66-$72 million, thereby confirming substantial supplier-driven IT spillovers downstream. We also infer the magnitude of the measurement error of the price deflator of the intermediate input resulting from the failure to account for IT-related quality improvement, finding that the measured price deflator overestimates the true deflator by approximately 30% at the mean level of IT capital.",2007-08,10/6/2015 3:37,1199-1216,,8,53,,Management Science,,,,,,,,,,,,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Organizations expend considerable effort to reduce opportunism. Agency theory espouses formal contracts as effective constraints on opportunism; however, a consultant's use of tacit knowledge subjects clients to information asymmetry that is not amenable to formal contracts. The principal-professional lens was developed to accommodate the presence of tacit knowledge, but it ignores formal contracts and, like agency theory, ignores the existence of principal opportunism. This examination of information systems (IS) consulting notes that when information asymmetry is present, both clients and consultants sometimes behave opportunistically. The level of information asymmetry, the type of knowledge, and the level of contract specificity in an IS consulting engagement determine the mixture of legal and social constraints that are efficacious. Based on these revelations and the inadequacy of other theories, a theoretical model of relationship constraints is developed to explain the interplay between signaling and screening, knowledge type, contract specificity, and the levels of information asymmetry in predicting adopted constraint mechanisms. For researchers, this new model offers a lens to study opportunism from a knowledge-based perspective, whereas for practitioners it offers the possibility of forestalling a decline in markets due to rampant opportunism.",2010,4/21/2016 0:46,143-178,,3,27,,Journal of Management Information Systems,Information Asymmetry in Information Systems Consulting,,,,,,,,,,,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper provides an interdisciplinary review of privacy-related research in order to enable a more cohesive treatment. With a sample of 320 privacy articles and 128 books and book sections, we classify previous literature in two ways: (1) using an ethics-based nomenclature of normative, purely descriptive, and empirically descriptive, and (2) based on their level of analysis: individual,group, organizational, and societal.Based upon our analyses via these two classification approaches, we identify three major areas in which previous research contributions reside: the conceptualization of information privacy, the relationship between information privacy and other constructs, and the contextual nature of these relationships.As we consider these major areas, we draw three overarching conclusions. First, there are many theoretical developments in the body of normative and purely descriptive studies that have not been addressed in empirical research on privacy. Rigorous studies that either trace processes associated with, or test implied assertions from, these value-laden arguments could add great value. Second, some of the levels of analysis have received less attention in certain contexts than have others in the research to date. Future empirical studies-both positivist and interpretive-could profitably be targeted to these under-researched levels of analysis. Third, positivist empirical studies will add the greatest value if they focus on antecedents to privacy concerns and on actual outcomes. In that light, we recommend that researchers be alert to an overarching macro model that we term APCO (Antecedents ? Privacy Concerns ? Outcomes).",2011-12,11/11/2015 21:23,980-A27,,4,35,,MIS Quarterly,Information Privacy Research,,,,,,,,,,,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CUZ6PIKM,document,,"Davis, Gordon B.",INFORMATION SYSTEMS CONCEPTUAL FOUNDATIONS,,,,,,"The academic field of information systems has developed because organizations use a  specialized body of knowledge about information and communications systems.  Teaching and research support these organization needs.  The field may be defined in terms of  observed information systems in organizations and also in terms of the function or field of activity for system planning, development, management, and evaluation. Since the systems deal with capture, repositories, processing, and communication of data, information, and knowledge, these are also defined. Conceptual foundations for the field are the set of concepts and propositions that explain why structures are designed the way they are, tasks are scheduled and accomplished in the way they are, and activities are performed the way they are.  There are three approaches to conceptual foundations: an intersection approach that accepts any concept from any  field if it appears to add insight and explanation to information systems practice and research, a core approach that seeks to define those ideas that characterize the discipline and make it distinct, and an evolutionary approach that seeks a cohesive set of concepts by combining the concepts from the core approach with concepts from other fields that over time are found to be especially useful to information systems. At this time, there is significant variety and a number of concepts that are said to be useful in research and practice.  In the long run, the evolutionary approach relative to conceptual foundations will probably prevail and reduce the scope and variety somewhat.  It is a mixed strategy that fits the diversity inherent in a worldwide community of scholars.  As the core concepts are developed and clarified, the core will be strengthened.  However, there will still continue to be strong use of other bodies of knowledge containing concepts that support explanation and research relative to information systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their research resulted in the widely cited DeLone and McLean (D&M) IS Success Model, in which System Quality, Information Quality, Use, User Satisfaction, Individual Impact, and Organizational Impact are distinct, but related dimensions of IS success. Since the original IS Success Model was published, research has developed a better understanding of IS success. Meanwhile, comprehensive and integrative research on the variables that influence IS success has been lacking. Therefore, we examine the literature on the independent variables that affect IS success. After examining over 600 articles, we focused our attention on integrating the findings of over 140 studies. In this research, we identify 43 specific variables posited to influence the different dimensions of IS success, and we organize these success factors into five categories based on the Leavitt Diamond of Organizational Change: task characteristics, user characteristics, social characteristics, project characteristics, and organizational characteristics. Next, we identify 15 success factors that have consistently been found to influence IS success: Enjoyment, Trust, User Expectations, Extrinsic Motivation, IT Infrastructure, Task Compatibility, Task Difficulty, Attitudes Toward Technology, Organizational Role, User Involvement, Relationship with Developers, Domain Expert Knowledge, Management Support, Management Processes, and Organizational Competence.

Is there a set of core principles we can apply to thinking about the enabling potential of information technologies and their consequences for business and society? We present a business-centric framework and a technologycentric framework that together form a blueprint for answering these questions. The business-centric framework articulates three compelling reasons why information technology (IT) matters in business: (1) IT continually transform industry and society, (2) executive decisions about IT investments, governance, and strategy are critical to organizational success, and (3) deriving value from increasingly available data trails de?nes effective decision making in the digital economy. However, our conversations with the leadership of 45 business schools and our subsequent data indicate that business schools are challenged by effectively training future executives to think about these reasons and act on them as part of a forward-looking program of business education that is grounded in stable concepts. In response, the technology-centric framework provides a set of grounding concepts and stable principles about IT that have emerged over the last four decades, and leads to a natural set of consequences that can inform thinking about IT in business. We illustrate how these complementary frameworks�business and technology�can be combined to frame an educational program by outlining a set of key questions, by placing these questions in the context suggested by our frameworks, and by providing guidelines toward answering them. These questions also de?ne a natural path for future research about IT in business and society that will lead to stronger intellectual foundations for the ?eld and de?ne future education that is better grounded in concepts and theories that emerge from academic research.",2007-06,9/5/2015 18:03,125+,,2,18,,,Information technologies in business,,,,,,,English,,,Academic OneFile,,Gale,,125,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet from a conceptual stand-point, few empirical studies have made a distinction between individuals' pre-adoption and post-adoption (continued use) beliefs and attitudes. This distinction is crucial in understanding and managing this process over time. The current study combines innovation diffusion and attitude theories in a theoretical framework to examine differences in pre-adoption and post-adoption beliefs and attitudes. The examination of Windows technology in a single organization indicates that users and potential adopters of information technology differ on their determinants of behavioral intention, attitude, and subjective norm. Potential adopter intention to adopt is solely determined by normative pressures, whereas user intention is solely determined by attitude. In addition, potential adopters base their attitude on a richer set of innovation characteristics than users. Whereas pre-adoption attitude is based on perceptions of usefulness, ease-of-use, result demonstrability, visibility, and trialability, post-adoption attitude is only based on instrumentality beliefs of usefulness and perceptions of image enhancements.",6/1/1999,9/16/2015 17:22,183-213,,2,23,,MIS Quarterly,Information Technology Adoption Across Time,,,,,,,,"Copyright � 1999 Management Information Systems Research Center, University of Minnesota",,,,JSTOR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Much of the extant research on the IT/strategy relationship, however, inaccurately frames IT as only a functional-level strategy. This widespread under-appreciation of the business-level role of IT indicates a need for substantial retheorizing of its role in strategy and its complex and interdependent relationship with the mechanisms through which firms generate profit. Using a comprehensive framework of potential profit mechanisms, we argue that while IT activities remain integral to the functional-level strategies of the firm, they also play several significant roles in business strategy, with substantial performance implications. IT affects industry structure and the set of business-level strategic alternatives and value-creation opportunities that a firm may pursue. Along with complementary organizational changes, IT both enhances the firm's current (ordinary) capabilities and enables new (dynamic) capabilities, including the flexibility to focus on rapidly changing opportunities or to abandon losing initiatives while salvaging substantial asset value. Such digitally attributable capabilities also determine how much of this value, once created, can be captured by the firm-and how much will be dissipated through competition or through the power of value chain partners, the governance of which itself depends on IT. We explore these business-level strategic roles of IT and discuss several provocative implications and future research directions in the converging information systems and strategy domains.",2013-06,10/18/2015 21:13,483-509,,2,37,,MIS Quarterly,Information Technology and Business-Level Strategy,,,,,,,,,,,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Current thought about information technology's consequences in organizations has been guided largely by theories with relatively simple notions of causal agency, which refers to the assumptions made by the analyst about the identity of the causal agent and its influence. Conflicting research findings in this area can be explained by the different meanings information technology acquires in different social settings. Logical structure refers to the logical relationships between the causes and the outcomes, while level of analysis refers to the entities about which the theory poses concepts and relationships.

We apply the integrative model to synthesize what is known about IT business value and guide future research by developing propositions and suggesting a research agenda. A principal finding is that IT is valuable, but the extent and dimensions are dependent upon internal and external factors, including complementary organizational resources of the firm and its trading partners, as well as the competitive and macro environment.

Recent work in social theory departs from prior traditions in proposing that social phenomena can be understood as comprising both subjective and objective elements. We apply this premise of duality to understanding the relationship between information technology and organizations. We construct a theoretical framework in which the development and deployment of information technology in organizations is a social phenomenon, and in which the organizational consequences of technology are products of both material and social dimensions. The framework is based on Giddens ' theory of structuration, and it allows us to progress beyond several of the false dichotomies (subjective vs objective, socially constructed vs material, macro vs micro, and qualitative vs quantitative) that persist in investigations of the interaction between organizations and information technology. The framework can be used to guide studies in two main areas of information systems research-- systems development and the organizational consequences of using information technology.",1991,,143�169,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,CiteSeer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we use Tobin's q, a financial market-based measure of firm performance and examine the association between IT investments and firm q values, after controlling for a variety of industry factors and firm-specific variables. The results based on data from 1988�1993 indicate that, in all of the five years, the inclusion of the IT expenditure variable in the model increased the variance explained in q significantly. The results also showed that, for all five years, IT investments had a significantly positive association with Tobin's q value.

The elusive link between IT and financial firm performance calls for further research into intermediate organizational variables through which IT may influence firm performance. This study proposes that knowledge management (KM) is a critical organizational capability through which IT influences firm performance. In the context of multibusiness firms, the study examines how the IT resources of a firm should be organized and managed to enhance the firm's KM capability, and whether and how KM capability influences firm performance. The study develops two hypothesizes: (1) IT relatedness of the firm's business units enhances cross-unit KM capability; (2) KM capability, in turn, leads to superior firm performance. Data from 250 Fortune 1000 firms provide empirical support for these hypotheses. IT relatedness of business units enhances the cross-unit KM capability of the firm. The KM capability creates and exploits cross-unit synergies from the product, customer, and managerial knowledge resources of the firm. These synergies increase the financial performance of the firm. IT relatedness also has significant indirect effects on firm performance through the mediation of KM capability.",2005,7/23/2016 20:59,311-334,,2,29,,MIS Quarterly,,,,,,,,,,,,,JSTOR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Completing such projects successfully requires close collaboration among all participants. Yet, achieving such collaboration is extremely difficult because of the complexity of the context: multiple and over-lapping boundaries associated with diverse organizational and national contexts separate the participants. These boundaries also lead to a pronounced imbalance of resources among onshore and offshore contributors giving rise to status differences and inhibiting collaboration. This research adopts a practice perspective to investigate how differences in country and organizational contexts give rise to boundaries and associated status differences in offshore application development projects and how these boundaries and status differences can be renegotiated in practice to establish effective collaboration. To illustrate and refine the theory, a qualitative case study of a large financial services firm, which sourced a variety of high-end IT work to its wholly owned subsidiaries (""captive centers"") and to third party vendors in multiple global locations (in particular, to India and Russia), is presented. Using a grounded theory approach, the paper finds that differences in country contexts gave rise to a number of boundaries that inhibited collaboration effectiveness, while differences in organizational contexts were largely mediated through organizational practices that treated vendor centers and captive units similarly. It also shows that some key onshore managers were able to alleviate status differences and facilitate effective collaboration across diverse country contexts by drawing on their position and resources. Implications are drawn for the theory and practice of global software development and multiparty collaboration.",2008-06,7/20/2016 22:54,307-332,,2,32,,MIS Quarterly,Innovating or Doing as Told?,,,,,,,,,,,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The enterprise system is introduced in accordance with the logic of managerial rationalism, but some of the institutional logics that organizational actors draw upon and reproduce contradict the logic of managerial rationalism in certain situations. In these situations, organizational actors loosely couple elements of their practices from the practices implied by the enterprise system, thus satisfying the demands associated with both institutional fields. We identify four generalizable forms of loose coupling that result from these institutional contradictions: temporal, material, procedural, and interpretive, and discuss their effects on both the system implementation and local practices. Further, we show how, through the use of institutional logics, researchers can identify fundamental institutional contradictions that explain regularities in the situated responses to enterprise system implementations�regularities that are consistently identified in the literature across a variety of organizational contexts.",7/26/2011,9/24/2015 1:03,376-396,,2,23,,Information Systems Research,Institutional Contradictions and Loose Coupling,,,,,,,,,,,,pubsonline.informs.org (Atypon),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Instead of looking for economic impacts of the now-available technological tools, this research investigates how local individuals use (or not) computers, and analyses the mechanisms by which computermediated information, obtained by those who use computers, is disseminated through their customary face-to-face interactions with their compatriots. A holistic multiple-case study design was the basis for the data collection process. Data were collected during four-and-half months of fieldwork. Grounded theory informed both the method of data analysis and the technique for theory building. As a result of an inductive thinking process, two intertwined core themes emerged. The first theme, individuals� exploitation of ICT, is related to how some individuals overcome some difficulties and try to make the most of the now available ICT tools. The second theme, complementing existing social networks through ICT, reflects the interaction between the newly ICT-mediated information and virtual networks and the local existing social networks. However, these two themes were not evenly distributed across the communities studied. The evidence revealed that dissimilarities in social cohesion among the communities and, to some extent, disparities in physical infrastructure are contributing factors that explain the unevenness. But social actors � named as �activators of information� � become the key triggers of the disseminating process for fresh and valuable ICT-mediated information throughout their communities. These findings were compared to the relevant literature to produce theoretical generalisations. As a conclusion, it is suggested any ICT intervention in a developing country requires at least three elements to be effective: a tolerable physical infrastructure, a strong degree of social texture and an activator of information.",2005,4/24/2016 1:01,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, while technology becomes more and more pervasive, an age-related underutilisation of IT remains observable. For instance, elderly people (65 years of age and older) are significantly less likely to use the Internet than the average population (see, for instance, European Commission, 2011). This age-related digital divide prevents many elderly people from using IT to enhance their quality of life through tools, such as Internet-based service delivery. Despite the significance of this phenomenon, the information systems (IS) literature lacks a comprehensive consideration and explanation of technology acceptance in general and more specifically, Internet adoption by the elderly. This paper thus studies the intentions of the elderly with regard to Internet use and identifies important influencing factors. Four alternative models based on technology acceptance theory are tested in the context of comprehensive survey data. As a result, a model that explains as much as 84% of the variance in technology adoption among the elderly is developed. We discuss the contribution of our analyses to the research on Internet adoption (and IT adoption in general) by the elderly, on the digital divide, and on technology acceptance and identify potentially effective paths for future research and theoretical development.",2014-11,2/19/2016 3:48,708-726,,6,23,,,Internet adoption by the elderly,,,,,,,English,� Operational Research Society 2014,,,,ProQuest,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We compare the complexity of this knowledge integration task to previous efforts in terms of its novelty and the organizational properties of specialization and dependence that are required. Drawing on evidence from two empirical studies, we outline three stages of the �knowledge transformation cycle,� which addresses the complexity of this integration task.

Teams comprised of individuals with diverse skills and expertise may be well suited to perform such work. However, as teams become more prevalent, organizations may struggle with ways to exercise control. Formal controls, with their focus on prespecified rules, performance targets, and hierarchical relationships, may be less effective in a teamwork environment than clan control, in which work-related behavior is motivated by shared norms and values, as well as a common vision, and individuals attempt to be accepted or ""regular"" members of a team. However, little is known about the antecedents of clan control. Much of the existing empirical research on the antecedents of control has been influenced by Ouchi's (Ouchi, W. G. 1977. The relationship between organizational structure and organizational control. Admin. Sci. Quart. 22 95-113) framework, which posits clan control is used when managers lack knowledge of means-ends relationships and are unable to measure outcomes. This paper adopts the view that clan control is a ""people"" or social process and argues that social capital, a construct that reflects connections and relationships among individuals, is a missing, key antecedent of clan control. In particular, we posit that the existence of social capital enables team members, as well as project managers, to facilitate clan control within a team, i.e., team-based clan control. A model is developed and hypotheses are tested using survey data collected from 95 information systems project teams. The results suggest that social capital assets are associated with team-based clan control. Recognizing that the project manager typically has a different level of organizational authority than team members, additional hypotheses are developed relating characteristics of the project manager to team-based clan control. The results of these tests suggest that team-based clan control is also dependent on the manager's knowledge of business processes and the application area, coupled with the extent to which he observes the behaviors of the project team. Thus, our results suggest that there are conditions under which team-based clan control is facilitated by the project team as a whole (including team members and project managers), as well as conditions under which team-based clan control is facilitated by project managers in their role as team leaders. Implications and suggestions for future work are discussed.",4/3/2010,11/3/2015 14:32,469-489,,2,21,,Organization Science,Investigating the Antecedents of Team-Based Clan Control,,,,,,,,,,,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With multiyear multi-firm ERP implementation and financial data, we find that firms that invest in ERP tend to show higher performance across a wide variety of financial metrics. Even though there is a slowdown in business performance and productivity shortly after the implementation, financial markets consistently reward the adopters with higher market valuation (as measured by Tobin's q).

This study addresses these two questions by providing a conceptual model of five types of core IT artifacts and a five-facet framework of IS scholars� approaches to studying IT artifacts. Using a critical literature review, the conceptualizations are tested with the collective wisdom by IS scholars in the most recent IS studies published in the 2009 and 2010 ICIS proceedings. The findings shed light on where the IS discipline is standing in terms of its focus on IT artifacts. Implications for research and practice are discussed. This study contributes to our continued understanding of the development and evolution of the IS discipline and the potential directions it may take.",2011,9/6/2015 4:00,,,,,,,,,,,,Social Science Research Network,"Rochester, NY",,,SSRN Scholarly Paper,,,papers.ssrn.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to improve knowledge sharing supported by information technology (IT), tools need to be embedded in the social networks of which it is part. This has implications for our knowledge on the design requirements of such socially embedded IT. The paper reviews tools that are designed for the purpose to foster social capital. We will then discuss what is needed for an IS design theory related to knowledge communities and how such a theory could incorporate social capital theory.

It is an alternative to structural ambidexterity in which separate units of the IOR pursue short- and long-term goals. We theorize that when utilized to coordinate the IOR, information technology (IT)-enabled operations and sensemaking, along with interdependent decision making, promote the IOR's contextual ambidexterity. We test our hypotheses on both sides of a customer-vendor relationship using data collected from (1) the account executives of one of the world's largest supply chain vendors (n = 76) and (2) its customers (n = 238). We find commonalities and differences in the influence coordination mechanisms have on contextual ambidexterity from the vendor's and the customer's perspectives. For both customers and vendors, contextual ambidexterity improves the quality and performance of the relationship, and decision interdependence promotes contextual ambidexterity. For customers, using operations support systems (OSSs) and interpretation support systems (ISSs) enhances contextual ambidexterity. For vendors, the impact of both OSS use and ISS use on contextual ambidexterity depends on the duration of the relationship. Our study shows that IT-enabled operations and sensemaking are key enablers of IOR ambidexterity and that vendors should combine these IT capabilities with relationship-specific knowledge that accumulates with relationship duration.",11/11/2013,4/14/2016 20:53,72-92,,1,25,,Information Systems Research,,,,,,,,,,,,,pubsonline.informs.org (Atypon),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Edwards,,,,,http://misqe.org/ojs2/index.php/misqe/article/view/49&lt,/ee&gt,,"Over a period of eight years, 1995-2003, J.D. Edwards evolved three innovative approaches to knowledge management (KM). The evolution in each started with a grass-roots team effort and grew to become an institutionalized enterprise application. With limited resources, J.D. Edwards has built a Global Web site Community, a sophisticated intranet/extranet (called the Knowledge Garden?), and a content management application (called Content Manager) that allows people to reuse multilingual technical documents, drawing them from a ""single source"" location. The evolution of these three projects is analyzed using a four-phase stage model and illustrates 12 lessons for others on how to more effectively plan an enterprise KM project, anticipate change, and set appropriate expectations. In the initiation stage, organizations need to identify and encourage an evangelist or champion to gain executive support and sponsorship. In the contagion stage, organizations need to establish content ownership and useful standards, and devise innovative ways of aligning the KM project with revenue generation. In the control stage, organizations need to anticipate the ongoing needs of updating the technologies and improving the governance processes. Finally, in the integration stage, organizations need to find a unifying vision and use techniques that will institutionalize knowledge management. The impact of these enterprise content management initiatives at J.D. Edwards has been considerable. Early ROI studies on the Knowledge Garden indicated an 1811% return, totaling $5 million annually in saved time and reduced paper costs. Content Manager, with a 270% ROI the first year, has been a consistent revenue driver, delivering over $7 million to the bottom line by early 2003?C-and an additional $7.5 million from the Web-based training tool and courseware. By February 2002, jdedwards.com was driving over $10 million worth of pipeline leads.",,4/24/2016 0:28,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Firms are assumed to have always been oriented toward accumulating and applying knowledge to create economic value and competitive advantage. We therefore suggest the need for a KMPI which we have defined as a logistic function having five components that can be used to determine the knowledge circulation process (KCP): knowledge creation, knowledge accumulation, knowledge sharing, knowledge utilization, and knowledge internalization. When KCP efficiency increases, KMPI will also expand, enabling firms to become knowledge-intensive. To prove KMPI�s contribution, a questionnaire survey was conducted on 101 firms listed in the KOSDAQ market in Korea. We associated KMPI with three financial measures: stock price, price earnings ratio (PER), and R&amp;D expenditure. Statistical results show that the proposed KMPI can represent KCP efficiency, while the three financial performance measures are also useful.",2005-03,8/2/2016 20:44,469-482,,3,42,,Information & Management,KMPI,,,,,,,,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We find that the mix of moves exercised in technical support strongly depends on the formulation of tasks by those requesting support.

Firms are social communities which use their relational structure and shared coding schemes to enhance the transfer and communication of new skills and capabilities. To replicate new knowledge in the absence of a social community is difficult. A classic demonstration is the well-studied problem of the transfer across country borders of manufacturing capabilities that support production of new product innovations. We show in this article that the degree of codification and how easily capabilities are taught has a significant influence on the speed of transfer. What makes the question of knowledge codification particularly interesting is that firms compete not only through the creation, replication, and transfer of their own knowledge, but also through their ability to imitate the product innovations of competitors. The capacity to speed the internal transfer of a production capability to new markets (e.g., those in other countries) is, consequently, of fundamental significance in a competitive environment. In the attempt to speed the internal transfer of knowledge, the dilemma arises that capabilities which can be easily communicated within the firm are more likely to be easily imitated by competitors. This relationship is tested by analyzing the effects of the ease of codifying and communicating a manufacturing capability not only on the time to its transfer, but also on the time to imitation of the new product. �The determinants of the time to imitation are found to be the extent to which knowledge of the manufacturing processes is �common� among competitors, and the degree of continuous recombination of capabilities leading to improvement of the product or the manufacturing process. We support this interpretation by a discussion of the results from field research. A wider implication of these findings is the proposition that the transfer and recombination of organizational capabilities are the foundation of an evolutionary theory of the firm. A critical element limiting the expansion of a firm is that the competitive value of codifying knowledge leads to the selection of organizing principles that are not functional in all competitive environments. The pressure of speed is of critical importance to understand the evolutionary advantage of nonoptimal rules of coordinated action within a social community.",2/1/1995,8/2/2016 20:18,76-92,,1,6,,Organization Science,Knowledge and the Speed of the Transfer and Imitation of Organizational Capabilities,,,,,,,,,,,,pubsonline.informs.org (Atypon),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigate how organizational innovation outcomes vary by founders� initial mode of venture ideation. We then compare how firms established with knowledge-brokering-based ideation differ in their methods of sustaining ongoing knowledge-brokering capacity compared with firms not established in such a manner. We do so by tracking all the start-up biotechnology firms founded to commercialize the then-emergent recombinant DNA technology (the sample of initial knowledge brokers) together with a contemporaneously founded sample of biotechnology firms that did not license the DNA technology (the sample of initial nonbrokers). Our results suggest that (a) ongoing knowledge brokering has an inverted U-shaped relationship with innovative performance in general; (b) initial knowledge brokers have a positive imprinting effect on their organizations� search patterns over time, resulting in superior performance relative to nonbrokers; and (c) initial nonbrokers rely more on external channels of sourcing knowledge, such as hiring technical staff, relative to initial brokers, reinforcing the imprinting interpretation.

Extending communication theory, we identify four challenges to knowledge integration in virtual team environments: constraints on transactive memory, insufficient mutual understanding, failure in sharing and retaining contextual knowledge, and inflexibility of organizational ties.

Such supply-side arguments are limited to the extent that they do not address the demand for knowledge within organizations. This paper takes a novel approach to understanding how access to others' knowledge produces benefits by studying the extent to which individuals intentionally access each other's expertise, experience, insights, and opinions, which we term knowledge sourcing. A general model of knowledge sourcing, including contextual and dispositional antecedents and learning outcomes, is proposed and validated using survey data from a global organization. Knowledge sourcing explains a significant proportion of individuals' learning outcomes, but the strength of this effect is moderated both by the strength of individuals' learning orientations and the degree to which they find their jobs to be intellectually demanding. For researchers, this study extends existing knowledge by proposing, testing, and validating a new way to understand an important KM issue in organizations. Practitioners can use these findings to evaluate existing KM efforts and better target future KM interventions towards those individuals most likely to benefit.",6/1/2004,7/23/2016 20:46,821-834,,6,50,,Management Science,,,,,,,,,,,,,pubsonline.informs.org (Atypon),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Extant research has highlighted the challenges associated with managing knowledge in virtual settings. However, researchers are still struggling to provide effective guidance to practitioners in this field. We believe that a better understanding of individual virtual competency is a potential avenue for managing the complexity of knowledge transfer in virtual settings. In particular, we suggest that optimal knowledge transfers can be achieved by individuals armed with the right personal capabilities and skills for virtual work, particularly when those knowledge transfers are emergent, bottom-up and cannot be specified a priori. The virtual competency exhibited by individuals can be the key to overcoming the constraints of knowledge transfers with such characteristics because underlying competency can facilitate effective action in unfamiliar and novel situations. In this conceptual research, we develop a theoretical model of individual virtual competence and describe its role in the communication process, which underpins effective knowledge transfer in virtual settings. Additionally, we consider the antecedent role that prior experience in virtual activity plays in aiding workers to develop virtual competence, which in turn engenders effective knowledge transfer. We conclude with implications for future research and for practicing managers.",11/1/2009,3/21/2016 1:09,571-593,,6,19,,,Knowledge transfer in virtual settings,,,,,,,en,� 2008 The Authors.

If poorly managed, the resulting disruptions in customer service and environmental problems incur enormous recovery costs, prompt large legal liabilities, and damage customer goodwill and brand equity. Yet, despite conventional wisdom that firms should improve their own operations by observing problems that occur in others� processes, significant operational risks appear to be ignored and similar losses recur. Using a randomized vignette-based field experiment, we tested the influence of organization-level factors on knowledge acquisition. Two organization-level factors, namely perceived operational similarity, and to a lesser extent, market leadership, significantly influenced the risk manager's likelihood of acquiring knowledge about possible causes that triggered another firm's operational loss. These findings suggest that senior managers need to develop organizational systems and training to expand the screening by risk managers to enhance knowledge acquisition. Moreover, industry and trade organizations may have a role in fostering the transfer of knowledge and potential learning from operational losses of firms.",2013-01,3/20/2016 22:41,52-61,,1�2,31,,Journal of Operations Management,Learning from others� misfortune,Behavioral Operations,,,,,,,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I argue that the locus of supplier capability deployment, i.e. whether supplier capabilities are deployed at the client (in-sourcing) or supplier (outsourcing), has implications for client firm performance. The findings show that in-sourcing leads to complementary effects between supplier IT capabilities and client operational capabilities. In contrast, clients with weaker operational capabilities benefit from outsourcing the respective activity to the supplier, and may even be able to reduce their capability disadvantage through outsourcing.

To better understand the workings of open source environments, we examine the effects of network embeddedness--or the nature of the relationship among projects and developers--on the success of open source projects. We find that considerable heterogeneity exists in the network embeddedness of open source projects and project managers. We use a visual representation of the affiliation network of projects and developers as well as a formal statistical analysis to demonstrate this heterogeneity and to investigate how these structures differ across projects and project managers. Our main results surround the effect of this differential network embeddedness on project success. We find that network embeddedness has strong and significant effects on both technical and commercial success, but that those effects are quite complex. We use latent class regression analysis to show that multiple regimes exist and that some of the effects of network embeddedness are positive under some regimes and negative under others. We use project age and number of page views to provide insights into the direction of the effect of network embeddedness on project success.

Such efforts, however, are complex and very demanding. A variety of risks makes it difficult to develop and implement new processes. We studied SPI in its organizational context through collaborative practice research (CPR), a particular form of action research. The CPR program involved close collaboration between practitioners and researchers over a three-year period to understand and improve SPI initiatives in four Danish software organizations. The problem of understanding and managing risks in SPI teams emerged in one of the participating organizations and led to this research. We draw upon insights from the literature on SPI and software risk management as well as practical lessons learned from managing SPI risks in the participating software organizations. Our research offers two contributions. First, we contribute to knowledge on SPI by proposing an approach to understand and manage risks in SPI teams. This risk management approach consists of a framework for understanding risk areas and risk resolution strategies within SPI and a related process for managing SPI risks. Second, we contribute to knowledge on risk management within the information systems and software engineering disciplines. We propose an approach to tailor risk management to specific contexts. This approach consists of a framework for understanding and choosing between different forms of risk management and a process to tailor risk management to specific contexts.",2004-09,7/19/2016 18:57,395-433,,3,28,,MIS Quarterly,Managing Risk in Software Process Improvement,,,,,,,,,,,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Instead of considering virtual teams as qualitatively distinct from conventional teams, the degree of �virtuality� of teams is understood as a dimensional attribute. This review is guided by a lifecycle model in which five phases are distinguished in the management of teams with high virtuality: Preparation, launch, performance management, team development, and disbanding. The main focus of the review is on quantitative research with existing virtual teams in organizational contexts. However, experimental research and case studies are considered when no field studies are available. The major research results are summarized for human resource management tasks within these phases, and recommendations for practitioners are derived.",2005-03,1/25/2016 22:51,69-95,,1,15,,Human Resource Management Review,Managing virtual teams,,,,,,,,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Institutional ethnography aims to answer questions about how everyday life is organized. What is conventionally understood as ""the relationship of micro to macro processes"" is, in institutional ethnography, conceptualized and explored in terms of ruling relations. The authors suggest that institutional ethnographers must adopt a particular research stance, one that recognizes that people's own knolwedge and ways of knowing are crucial elements of social action and thus of social analysis. Specific attention to text analysis is integral to the approach. Institutional ethnography is remarkably well-suited to the human service curriculum and the training of professionals and activists. Its strategy for learning how to understand problems existing in everyday life appeals to many researchers who are looking for guidance on how to take practical action. At the same time, the highly elaborated theoretical foundation of institutional ethnography is difficult to deal with in the brief time most students are in the classroom. The authors successfully tackle the issue of teaching and applying institutional ethnography. Campbell and Gregor have been testing out instructional methods and materials for many years. Mapping Social Relations is the product of that effort.",5/1/2002,,,148,,,,,Mapping Social Relations,,,,,University of Toronto Press,,en,,,,,Google Books,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the growing number of gamers worldwide, adverse effects (isolation, hospitalizations, excessive use, etc.) are observed in a minority of gamers, which is a concern for society and for the scientific community. In the present study, we focused on screening gamers at potential risk of MMORPG addiction. Methods In this exploratory study, we focused on characteristics, online habits and problematic overuse in adult MMORPG gamers. In addition to socio-demographical data and gamer behavioral patterns, 3 different instruments for screening addiction were used in French MMORPG gamers recruited online over 10 consecutive months: the substance dependence criteria for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder, fourth revised edition (DSM-IV-TR) that has been adapted for MMORPG (DAS), the qualitative Goldberg Internet Addiction Disorder scale (GIAD) and the quantitative Orman Internet Stress Scale (ISS). For all scales, a score above a specific threshold defined positivity. Results The 448 participating adult gamers were mainly young adult university graduates living alone in urban areas. Participants showed high rates of both Internet addiction (44.2% for GIAD, 32.6% for ISS) and DAS positivity (27.5%). Compared to the DAS negative group, DAS positive gamers reported significantly higher rates of tolerance phenomenon (increased amount of time in online gaming to obtain the desired effect) and declared significantly more social, financial (OR: 4.85), marital (OR: 4.61), family (OR: 4.69) and/or professional difficulties (OR: 4.42) since they started online gaming. Furthermore, these gamers self-reported significantly higher rates (3 times more) of irritability, daytime sleepiness, sleep deprivation due to play, low mood and emotional changes since online gaming onset. Conclusions The DAS appeared to be a good first-line instrument to screen MMORPG addiction in online gamers. This study found high MMORPG addiction rates, and self-reported adverse symptoms in important aspects of life, including mood and sleep. This confirms the need to set up relevant prevention programs against online game overuse.",8/26/2011,9/22/2015 3:41,144,,,11,,BMC Psychiatry,Massively multiplayer online role-playing games,,,,,,,,,,,,PubMed Central,,PMID: 21871089 PMCID: PMC3176476,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As part of that  endeavor, this paper draws on structural symbolic interactionist identity theories to  systematically develop a conceptual definition of one such construct, IT identity� defined as the extent to which an individual views use of an IT as integral to his or her  sense of self�as a new form of identity. The construct is framed within a theoretical  model. Our goal is to facilitate the establishment of IT identity as an important and  relevant construct that can improve our understanding of a variety of phenomena.  In  doing so, this paper makes three contributions to the information systems (IS) literature.  First, it delineates current understanding of IT as a medium, determinant, or consequent  of identity. Second, it defines the conceptual domain and theme of IT identity, which is  necessary for investigating the construct�s theoretical influence. Third, it demonstrates  the utility of IT identity to a wide range of IS topics relating to how people express,  maintain, and expand their self-concepts. In doing so, it offers potential directions and  opportunities for IS researchers to incorporate this novel concept into IS research.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using the six dimensions of the D&M model - system quality, information quality, service quality, use, user satisfaction, and net benefits - 90 empirical studies were examined and the results summarized. Measures for the six success constructs are described and 15 pairwise associations between the success constructs are analyzed. This work builds on the prior research related to IS success by summarizing the measures applied to the evaluation of IS success and by examining the relationships that comprise the D&M IS success model in both individual and organizational contexts.

Media synchronicity theory (MST) focuses on the ability of media to support synchronicity, a shared pattern of coordinated behavior among individuals as they work together. We expand on the original propositions of MST to argue that communication is composed of two primary processes: conveyance and convergence. The familiarity of individuals with the tasks they are performing and with their coworkers will also affect the relative amounts of these two processes. Media synchronicity theory proposes that for conveyance processes, use of media supporting lower synchronicity should result in better communication performance. For convergence processes, use of media supporting higher synchronicity should result in better communication performance. We identify five capabilities of media (symbol sets, parallelism, transmission velocity, rehearsability, and reprocessability) that influence the development of synchronicity and thus the successful performance of conveyance and convergence communication processes. The successful completion of most tasks involving more than one individual requires both conveyance and convergence processes, thus communication performance will be improved when individuals use a variety of media to perform a task, rather than just one medium.",2008-09,10/23/2015 18:32,575-600,,3,32,,MIS Quarterly,"Media, Tasks, and Communication Processes",,,,,,,,,,,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These communities are empowered by new information technology-enabled collaborative tools, tools such as blogs, wikis, and social networks. Collaboration on these platforms is characterized by considerable membership turnover, which could have significant effects on collaborative outcomes. We hypothesize that membership retention relates in a curvilinear fashion to effective collaboration: positively up to a threshold and negatively thereafter. The longitudinal history of 2,065 featured articles on Wikipedia offers support for this hypotheses: Contributions from a mixture of new and experienced participants both increases the likelihood that an article will be promoted to featured article status and decreases the risk it will be demoted after having been promoted. These findings imply that, contrary to many of the assumptions in previous research, participant retention does not have a strictly positive effect on emerging collaborative environments. Further analysis of our data provides empirical evidence that knowledge creation and knowledge retention are actually distinct phases of community-based peer production, and that communities may on average experience more turnover than ideal during the knowledge retention phase.",2011-09,7/27/2016 21:28,613-627,,3,35,,MIS Quarterly,Membership Turnover and Collaboration Success in Online Communities,,,,,,,,,,,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, teens from lower income families and minority teens were significantly more likely to use their phones to go online. Together, these surprising trends suggest a potential narrowing of the digital divide, offering internet access to those without other means of going online. This is an important move, as, in today�s society, internet access is central to active citizenship in general and teen citizenship in particular. Yet the cost of this move toward equal access is absorbed by those who can least afford it: Teenagers from low income households. Using survey and focus group data from a national study of �Teens and Mobile Phone Use� (released by Pew and the University of Michigan in 2010), this article helps identify and explain this and other emergent trends for teen use (as well as non-use) of the internet through mobile phones.",5/13/2011,2/19/2016 3:31,144-158,,2,3,,,,,,,,,,en,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/,,,,www.mdpi.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The range of nations included paralleled many of those surveyed by Hofstede (1980) but added also substantial samples from ex-communist nations. Questionnaire items focused primarily on measures of universalism-particularism, achievement-ascription, and individualism-collectivism. Multidimensional scaling of country means revealed three interpretable dimensions. The relation of these dimensions to the results of earlier large-scale surveys and to a variety of demographic indexes is explored. It is found that there are continuing substantial differences in modal cultural values of organization employees and that these are largely consistent with differences reported by others. The present results suggest that the dimensions defined by Hofstede as individualism-collectivism and power distance may be better defined as representing varying orientations toward continuity of group membership (loyal involvement/ utilitarian involvement) and varying orientations toward the obligations of social relationship (conservatism/egalitarian commitment).",3/1/1996,2/8/2016 3:59,231-264,,2,27,,Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology,,,,,,,,en,,,,,jcc.sagepub.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a complement to previous research that has emphasized the dyadic tie strength component of informal networks, we focus on how network structure influences the knowledge transfer process. We propose that social cohesion around a relationship affects the willingness and motivation of individuals to invest time, energy, and effort in sharing knowledge with others. We further argue that the network range, ties to different knowledge pools, increases a person's ability to convey complex ideas to heterogeneous audiences. We also examine explanations for knowledge transfer based on absorptive capacity, which emphasizes the role of common knowledge, and relational embeddedness, which stresses the importance of tie strength. We investigate the network effect on knowledge transfer using data from a contract R&D firm. The results indicate that both social cohesion and network range ease knowledge transfer, over and above the effect for the strength of the tie between two people. We discuss the implications of these findings for research on effective knowledge transfer, social capital, and information diffusion.",6/1/2003,7/24/2016 2:16,240-267,,2,48,,Administrative Science Quarterly,Network Structure and Knowledge Transfer,,,,,,,en,,,,,asq.sagepub.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To do this well, we need to design our research so that it provides an intimate understanding of the practical problems facing the profession. Equally important, we need to appreciate and strengthen our skills in developing good theory so that research conducted about these problems will advance the knowledge that is relevant to both the discipline and the profession. Lewin's (1945) statement that ""nothing is so practical as a good theory"" captures a theme that is as important today as it was in Lewin's time. Good theory is practical precisely because it advances knowledge in a scientific discipline, guides research toward crucial questions, and enlightens the profession of management. This special forum focuses on criteria and methods for building good theory. Its purpose is to suggest ways to strengthen our theory-development capabilities, and thereby link better theory with the disciplines and professions represented in the Academy.",10/1/1989,9/14/2015 22:12,486-489,,4,14,,ACAD MANAGE REV,,,,,,,,en,,,,,amr.aom.org,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there is a certain amount of confusion about network theory�for example, what it is, what is distinctive about it, and how to generate new theory. This paper attempts to remedy the situation by clarifying the fundamental concepts of the field (such as the network) and characterizing how network reasoning works. We start by considering the definition of network, noting some confusion caused by two different perspectives, which we refer to as realist and nominalist. We then analyze two well-known network theories, Granovetter's strength of weak ties theory [Granovetter, M. S. 1973. The strength of weak ties. Amer. J. Sociol. 78(6) 1360�1380] and Burt's structural holes theory [Burt, R. S. 1992. Structural Holes: The Social Structure of Competition. Havard University Press, Cambridge, MA], to identify characteristic elements of network theorizing. We argue that both theories share an underlying theoretical model, which we label the network flow model, from which we derive additional implications. We also discuss network phenomena that do not appear to fit the flow model and discuss the possibility of a second fundamental model, which we call the bond model. We close with a discussion of the merits of model-based network theorizing for facilitating the generation of new theory, as well as a discussion of endogeneity in network theorizing.",4/11/2011,10/26/2015 20:29,1168-1181,,5,22,,Organization Science,,,,,,,,,,,,,pubsonline.informs.org (Atypon),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current study reviews and synthesizes extant empirical IS studies to provide a coherent view of research on RS and identify gaps and future directions. Specifically, we review 40 empirical studies of RS published in 31 IS journals and five IS conference proceedings between 1990 and 2013. Using a recommendation process theoretical framework, we categorize these studies in three major areas addressed by RS research: understanding consumers, delivering recommendations, and the impacts of RS.

This study examines the effect of negative reviews on retailer evaluation and patronage intention given that the consumer has already made a product/brand decision. Our results indicate that the extent of WOM search depends on the consumer's reasons for choosing an online retailer. Further the influence of negative WOM information on perceived reliability and purchase intentions is determined largely by familiarity with the retailer and differs based on whether the retailer is a pure-Internet or clicks-and-mortar firm.

However, to date, the individual-level dynamics of organizational culture have remained relatively neglected. This paper addresses this neglect by focusing on culture's manifestation in individuals' sensemaking structures and processes. Building off the social cognition literature, I propose that organizational culture's influence on individual sensemaking is revealed in the operation of a patterned system of organization-specific schemas. Schemas refer to the cognitive structures in which an individual's knowledge is retained and organized. In addition to being knowledge repositories, schemas also direct information acquisition and processing. They guide answering the questions central to sensemaking efforts: ""What or who is it?,"" ""What are its implications; what does it mean?,"" and ""How should I respond?"" After a brief review of schema theory, the categories of schema knowledge relevant to understanding sensemaking in organizations and the cultural influences on their emergence are examined. The conscious and unconscious operation of these schemas in the actual process of making sense of organizational stimuli is framed within a schema-directed, intrapsychic, mental dialogue perspective on social cognition. Specifically, I propose that in the social setting of organizations, individuals make sense out of their experiences based in large part on the outcomes of contrived mental dialogues between themselves (e.g., ""I think it means this and I would be inclined toward this response"") and other contextually-relevant (past or present; real or imagined) individuals or groups (e.g., ""What would my boss and peers think about this? What would they want me to do?""). The content of the argument provided for others is guided by the individual's schemas for those others. I close the paper by discussing the ways in which this schema-based perspective enhances our understanding of the individual experiences of cultural sharing, subcultural boundaries, and psychological attachment.",1994,4/14/2016 20:59,309-321,,3,5,,Organization Science,Organizational Culture and Individual Sensemaking,,,,,,,,,,,,JSTOR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is evidenced by the growing trend in the number of studies that address cultural issues in IS literature over the last several decades. Regardless of the contribution of many research studies up to now, various challenges still need to be addressed: firstly, studies continue to view culture as well integrated and shared equally among organizational members; secondly, there is a tendency for studies to downplay the dynamics of culture and how this influences IS adoption over time; and thirdly, there is an increased need to analyze culture using in-depth interpretative and longitudinal methods. This paper proposes that our understanding of IS culture can be enhanced by combining theoretical approaches in which the weakness of one approach can be complemented by the strength of another. More specifically, by combining Martin's (2002) three perspectives on culture � integration, differentiation and fragmentation and grid and group cultural theory (for instance, Douglas, 1970; Thompson et al., 1990), can offer a more penetrating account of how organizational culture influences IS adoption. This argument is demonstrated using an in-depth interpretative (retrospective) case study of a further and higher education college in the UK and its unsuccessful attempt to adopt a virtual learning environment (VLE).",2011-04,2/8/2016 0:44,57-83,,2,21,,Information and Organization,Organizational culture and information systems adoption,,,,,,,,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This fully updated and expanded edition showcases the most current research and insights, featuring a new chapter that provides a theoretical framework for analyzing organizational learning and presents evidence about how the organizational context affects learning processes and outcomes. Drawing from a wide array of studies across the spectrum of management, economics, sociology, and psychology, Organizational Learning explores the dynamics of learning curves in organizations, with particular emphasis on how individuals and groups generate, share, reinforce, and sometimes forget knowledge. With an increased emphasis on service organizations, including healthcare, Linda Argote demonstrates that organizations vary dramatically in the rates at which they learn�with profound implications for productivity, performance, and managerial and strategic decision making.",11/14/2012,,,226,,,,,Organizational Learning,,,,,Springer Science & Business Media,,en,,,,,Google Books,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper we take the position that the concept of sensemaking fills important gaps in organizational theory. The seemingly transient nature of sensemaking belies its central role in the determination of human behavior, whether people are acting in formal organizations or elsewhere. Sensemaking is central because it is the primary site where meanings materialize that inform and constrain identity and action. The purpose of this paper is to take stock of the concept of sensemaking. We do so by pinpointing central features of sensemaking, some of which have been explicated but neglected, some of which have been assumed but not made explicit, some of which have changed in significance over time, and some of which have been missing all along or have gone awry. We sense joint enthusiasm to restate sensemaking in ways that make it more future oriented, more action oriented, more macro, more closely tied to organizing, meshed more boldly with identity, more visible, more behaviorally defined, less sedentary and backward looking, more infused with emotion and with issues of sensegiving and persuasion. These key enhancements provide a foundation upon which to build future studies that can strengthen the sensemaking perspective.",2005,4/14/2016 20:57,409-421,,4,16,,Organization Science,,,,,,,,,,,,,JSTOR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first study analyzes a case of IOS in financial risk management and develops a game-theoretic model to understand the impact of ownership change in the IOS, from the ownership by a financial institution to third-party ownership. I analyze how the ownership change affects the service provider's investment in the system quality and the risk of exploitation of clients' information. One of the key results is that the third-party ownership increases the service quality of the IOS and mitigates the risk of information exploitation, which leads to greater adoption of the service even if the service is no longer free.",2006,,,114,,,,,Ownership and Business Value in Information Technologies,,,,,ProQuest,,en,,,,,Google Books,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

New firm-level data are used on several components of IS spending for 1987-1991. The dataset includes 367 large firms that generated approximately 1.8 trillion dollars in output in 1991. The IS data are supplemented with data on other inputs, output, and price deflators from other sources. The results indicate that IS spending has made a substantial and statistically significant contribution to firm output. It is found that the gross marginal product (MP) for computer capital averaged 81% for the firms in the sample. It is also found that the MP for computer capital is at least as large as the MP of other types of capital investment and that, dollar for dollar, IS labor spending generates at least as much output as spending on non-IS labor and expenses. It is concluded that the productivity paradox disappeared by 1991, at least in the sample of firms used.",1996-04,10/4/2015 17:52,541,,4,42,,,Paradox lost?,,,,,,,English,Copyright Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences Apr 1996,,,,ProQuest,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on an in-depth multi-case study of four software projects, we investigate how project managers, developers, testers and user representatives think about barriers to effective knowledge sharing in agile development. Adapting comparative causal mapping, we constructed causal maps for each of the four roles and identified overlap and divergence in map constructs and causal linkages. The results indicate that despite certain similarities, the four roles differ in how they perceive and emphasize knowledge-sharing barriers. The project managers put primary emphasis on project setting barriers, while the primary concern of developers, testers and user representatives were project communication, project organization and team capabilities barriers, respectively. Integrating the four causal maps and the agile literature, we propose a conceptual framework with seven types of knowledge-sharing barriers and 37 specific barriers. We argue that to bridge communication gaps and create shared understanding in software teams, it is critical to take the revealed concerns of different roles into account. We conclude by discussing our findings in relation to knowledge sharing in agile teams and software teams more generally.",3/1/2016,8/3/2016 23:00,95-125,,2,26,,Info Systems J,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most subjective measures used in practice are unvalidated, and their relationship to system usage is unknown. The present research develops and validates new scales for two specific variables, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, which are hypothesized to be fundamental determinants of user acceptance. Definitions for these two variables were used to develop scale items that were pretested for content validity and then tested for reliability and construct validity in two studies involving a total of 152 users and four application programs. The measures were refined and stream-lined, resulting in two six-item scales with reliabilities of.98 for usefulness and.94 for ease of use. The scales exhibited high convergent, discriminant, and factorial validity. Perceived usefulness was significantly correlated with both self-reported current usage (r=.63, Study 1) and self-predicted future usage (r=.85, Study 2). Perceived ease of use was also significantly correlated with current usage (r=.45, Study 1) and future usage (r=.59, Study 2). In both studies, usefulness had a significantly greater correlation with usage behavior than did ease of use. Regression analyses suggest that perceived ease of use may actually be a causal antecedent to perceived usefulness, as opposed to a parallel, direct determinant of system usage. Implications are drawn for future research on user acceptance.",9/1/1989,9/16/2015 16:00,319-340,,3,13,,MIS Quarterly,,,,,,,,,"Copyright � 1989 Management Information Systems Research Center, University of Minnesota",,,,JSTOR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Management Information System (MIS) literature discusses a communication gap between the organization oriented users and the more technical systems staff. It is often hypothesized that systems personnel and users are different in terms of personality and behavior characteristics and that these differences are one of the primary reasons for the existence of a communication gap. This article summarizes a two-phased study. The first phase investigated personality characteristics of respondents from thirty-two large organizations who worked on design teams. The second phase examines, in detail, a system success and failure in one organization. Analysis was performed to see if there are significant differences on personality dimensions between users and systems personnel and to explore the relationship between these differences and system success. An denationalization of Jung's personality typology (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator) was employed. The results show that the users involved in the systems design are very similar to their systems counterparts. Even more surprising is that the characteristics of these users are closer to the popular descriptions of systems staff than the analysts are. They also suggest that these similarities in personality types may have an impact on system success. The general implications of these findings in terms of the management of project teams and the MIS designs they create are discussed.",1982-12,7/19/2016 18:52,43-60,,4,6,,MIS Quarterly,Personality Characteristics of MIS Project Teams,,,,,,,,,,,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I study this question using a qualitative study of outsourcing in the information technology department of a large financial services firm. Traditional transaction cost-based theories argue that decisions about which transactions to outsource should reflect the characteristics of those transactions, yet I find only a weak link between transaction characteristics and outsourcing decisions. Qualitative evidence suggests that managers' pursuit of their own intraorganizational interests helps to explain why outsourcing decisions were often divorced from transaction characteristics. I found that the consequences of outsourcing projects were consistent with the assumptions of transaction cost and capabilities-based theories: managers had less authority over outsourced projects than internal ones, those projects were subject to weaker administrative controls, and outsourced vendors provided different capabilities than internal suppliers. However, the way that those consequences were evaluated often reflected managers' own interests rather than those of the organization. I highlight three aspects of organizational structure that affected how managers evaluated outsourcing: the nature of differentiated goals and responsibilities, the administrative controls that managers faced, and the pressures caused by interdependent workflows within the organization. I also show how the distribution of authority and other resources shaped which projects were outsourced. The analysis highlights the value of understanding make-or-buy decisions as an endogenous consequence of the structure in which those decisions take place, rather than as isolated decisions that are maximized regardless of their context.",9/10/2012,4/21/2016 0:44,1622-1642,,6,23,,Organization Science,Politics and Firm Boundaries,,,,,,,,,,,,pubsonline.informs.org.ezproxy.baylor.edu (Atypon),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study investigates how the national politics affects IT investment profiles in U.S. federal agencies. Drawing upon a range of the literature from the political sciences, public administration, and information systems (IS) disciplines, we hypothesize that a federal agency�scapacity-building IT investments are associated with (i) the diversity of its functions, (ii) legislative approval for chief executives, (iii) government dividedness, and (iv) the agency�sideological characteristics. With a panel dataset from 133 federal agencies and bureaus in 2003-2015 spanning the Bush and the Obama Administrations, our empirical analyses produce several intriguing findings. For instance, when both the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives are controlled by the President�s ruling party, federal agencies are predicted to invest approximately $4.19%-point more in new IT development and modernization than when the opposition party holds the majority in both chambers. We contribute to the IS literature in two fronts. To the best of our knowledge, ours is one of the first to study the role and impact of principals (legislatures and board-of-directors) on IT investment decisions. We also examine what affects budget allocation decisions between IT development and maintenance, which to the best of our knowledge, few IS studies have studied so far.",2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Drawing on five cases, it concludes that many findings from research on control of internal ISD projects apply to the outsourced context as well, but with some interesting differences. The portfolios of control in outsourced projects are dominated by outcome controls, especially at the start of the project; although the precision and frequency of these controls varies across projects. Behavior controls are often added later in the project, as are controls aimed to encourage and enable vendor self-control. Clan controls were used in only two of the cases - when the client and vendor had shared goals, and when frequent interactions led to shared values. In general, the outsourced projects we studied began with relatively simple controls but often required significant additional controls after experiencing performance problems. Factors influencing the choice and evolution of controls are also examined.

This research examines one aspect of the management process: the function of control. In this paper, control is viewed broadly, encompassing all attempts to ensure individuals in organizations act in a manner that is consistent with meeting organizational goals and objectives. Control is categorized into formal modes (behavioral, outcome) and informal modes (clan, self). Formal and informal control modes are implemented via a variety of mechanisms, such as linking pay with performance, socialization, and team-building. Relatively little is known about the modes of control used to manage information systems development efforts. The objective of this research is to address this lack of understanding in the literature by exploring hozv control modes are implemented during systems development projects and by investigating why IS and user stakeholders implement particular combinations of control modes. To meet this objective, a series of four case studies of systems development projects was conducted. The results reveal that users, as well as IS managers, play a critical role in controlling systems development projects. Moreover, the results suggest that all stakeholders implement a portfolio of control modes that typically includes both formal and informal modes. This portfolio contains a mix of overlapping and redundant mechanisms used to exercise these modes of control. The results also suggest that constructing a portfolio of control modes is a process that includes selecting appropriate preexisting mechanisms of formal control; designing new mechanisms with which to implement formal control, if necessary; and supplementing the mechanisms of formal control with mechanisms of informal control. Throughout this process of construction, the choice of particular control mechanisms depends on task characteristics, role expectations, and project-related knowledge and skills.",1997,11/17/2015 21:47,215-239,,3,8,,Information Systems Research,,,,,,,,,,,,,JSTOR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three basic theories of the causes of resistance underlie many prescriptions and rules for MIS implementation. Simply stated, people resist MIS because of their own internal factors, because of poor system design, and because of the interaction of specific system design features with aspects of the organizational context of system use. These theories differ in their basic assumptions about systems, organizations, and resistance; they also differ in predictions that can be derived from them and in their implications for the implementation process. These differences are described and the task of evaluating the theories on the bases of the differences is begun.

Predictive analytics include empirical methods (statistical and other) that generate data predictions as well as methods for assessing predictive power. Predictive analytics not only assist in creating practically useful models, they also play an important role alongside explanatory modeling in theory building and theory testing. We describe six roles for predictive analytics: new theory generation, measurement development, comparison of competing theories, improvement of existing models, relevance assessment, and assessment of the predictability of empirical phenomena. Despite the importance of predictive analytics, we find that they are rare in the empirical IS literature. The latter relies nearly exclusively on explanatory statistical modeling, where statistical inference is used to test and evaluate the explanatory power of underlying causal models. However, explanatory power does not imply predictive power and thus predictive analytics are necessary for assessing predictive power and for building empirical models that predict well. To show the distinction between predictive analytics and explanatory statistical modeling, we present differences that arise in the modeling process of each type. These differences translate into different final models, so that a pure explanatory statistical model is best tuned for testing causal hypotheses and a pure empirical predictive model is best in WHUPVRISUHGLFWLYHSRZHU?:H�FRQYHUW�DZHOO-known explanatory paper on TAM to a predictive context to illustrate these differences and show how predictive analytics can add theoretical and practical value to IS research.",2010,1/25/2016 21:47,06�138,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Google Scholar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the growing prominence of canonical action research (CAR) in the information systems discipline, a paucity of methodological guidance continues to hamper those conducting and evaluating such studies. This article elicits a set of five principles and associated criteria to help assure both the rigor and the relevance of CAR in information systems. The first principle relates to the development of an agreement that facilitates collaboration between the action researcher and the client. The second principle is based upon a cyclical process model for action research that consists of five stages: diagnosis, planning, intervention, evaluation and reflection. Additional principles highlight the critical roles of theory, change through action, and the specification of learning in terms of implications for both research and practice. The five principles are illustrated through the analysis of one recently published CAR study.",1/1/2004,7/19/2016 18:58,65-86,,1,14,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper focuses on the fact that while productivity, consumer value, and business profitability are related, they are ultimately separate questions. Accordingly, the empirical results on IT value depend heavily on which question is being addressed and what data are being used. Applying methods based on economic theory we are able to define and examine the relevant hypotheses for each of these three questions, using recent firm-level data on IT spending by 370 large firms. Our findings indicate that IT has increased productivity and created substantial value for consumers. However, we do not find evidence that these benefits have resulted in supranormal business profitability. We conclude that while modeling techniques need to be Improved, these results are collectively consistent with economic theory.

We found that KMS had significant positive impacts on individual performance and that these performance benefits grew over time. Moreover, experience moderated the relationship between KMS use and individual performance. Knowledge workers with more experience were able to more quickly absorb and apply the knowledge from the KMS than were those with less experience, who took longer to benefit from KMS use.

Drawing on both qualitative and quantitative data, we show that patenting is a minority activity: a majority of the faculty in our sample never patent, and publication rates far outstrip patenting rates. Most faculty members estimate that patents account for less than 10% of the knowledge that transfers from their labs. Our results also suggest that in two important ways patenting is not representative of the patterns of knowledge generation and transfer from MIT: patent volume does not predict publication volume, and those firms that cite MIT papers are in general not the same firms as those that cite MIT patents. However, patent volume is positively correlated with paper citations, suggesting that patent counts may be reasonable measures of research impact. We close by speculating on the implications of our results for the difficult but important question of whether, in this setting, patenting acts as a substitute or a complement to the process of fundamental research.",1/1/2002,7/24/2016 2:19,44-60,,1,48,,Management Science,Putting Patents in Context,,,,,,,,,,,,pubsonline.informs.org (Atypon),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We test this conjecture using the revenue distributions of books in over 200 distinct categories on Amazon.com and detailed daily snapshots of co-purchase recommendation networks in which the products of these categories are situated. We measure how much a product is influenced by its position in this hyperlinked network of recommendations using a variant of Google's PageRank measure of centrality. We then associate the average influence of the network on each category with the inequality in the distribution of its demand and revenue,quantifying this inequality using the Gini coefficient derived from the category's Lorenz curve. We establish that categories whose products are influenced more by the recommendation network have significantly flatter demand and revenue distributions, even after controlling for variation in average category demand, category size, and price differentials. Our empirical findings indicate that doubling the average network influence on a category is associated with an average increase of about 50 percent in the relative revenue for the least popular 20 percent of products, and with an average reduction of about 15 percent in the relative revenue for the most popular 20 percent of products. We also show that this effect is enhanced by higher assortative mixing and lower clustering in the network, and is greater in categories whose products are more evenly influenced by recommendations. The direction of these results persists over time, across both demand and revenue distributions, and across both daily and weekly demand aggregations. Our work illustrates how the microscopic economic data revealed by online networks can be used to define and answer new kinds of research questions, offers a fresh perspective on the influence of networked IT artifacts on business outcomes, and provides novel empirical evidence about the impact of visible recommendations on the long tail of electronic commerce.",2012-03,10/4/2015 2:59,65-A4,,1,36,,MIS Quarterly,,,,,,,,,,,,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Drawing on social capital theory and the relational view of the firm, we argue that geographically localized social capital affects a firm's ability to innovate through various external channels. Combining data on social capital at the regional level, with a large-scale data set of the innovative activities of a representative sample of 2,413 Italian manufacturing firms from 21 regions, and controlling for a large set of firm and regional characteristics, we find that being located in a region characterized by a high level of social capital leads to a higher propensity to innovate. We find also that being located in an area characterized by a high degree of localized social capital is complementary to firms' investments in internal research and development (R&D) and that such a location positively moderates the effectiveness of externally acquired R&D on the propensity to innovate.",5/17/2011,3/20/2016 23:48,177-193,,1,23,,Organization Science,Regions Matter,,,,,,,,,,,,pubsonline.informs.org.ezproxy.baylor.edu (Atypon),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet, drawing on a review of the full set of articles published in Information Systems Research (ISR) over the past ten years, we argue that the field has not deeply engaged its core subject matter�the information technology (IT) artifact. Instead, we find that IS researchers tend to give central theoretical significance to the context (within which some usually unspecified technology is seen to operate), the discrete processing capabilities of the artifact (as separable from its context or use), or the dependent variable (that which is posited to be affected or changed as technology is developed, implemented, and used). The IT artifact itself tends to disappear from view, be taken for granted, or is presumed to be unproblematic once it is built and installed. After discussing the implications of our findings, we propose a research direction for the IS field that begins to take technology as seriously as its effects, context, and capabilities. In particular, we propose that IS researchers begin to theorize specifically about IT artifacts, and then incorporate these theories explicitly into their studies. We believe that such a research direction is critical if IS research is to make a significant contribution to the understanding of a world increasingly suffused with ubiquitous, interdependent, and emergent information technologies.",2001-06,,121-134,,2,12,,ISR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The assumptions and logic of these quests have become less relevant in increasingly complex adaptive business systems (CABS), where the competitive performance landscapes of products and services are highly dynamic and co-evolve. We revise the strategic alignment quest to propose a co-evolution quest that addresses not only competitive strategy questions of a firm but also corporate strategy questions. The co-evolution quest seeks to increase a firm's agility and dynamism in repositioning itself, identifying profitable product-market positions as the evolving competitive landscape erodes the profitability of the firm's existing positions. To support the co-evolution quest, we revise the integration quest and propose a reconfiguration quest that encompasses not only business processes but also products and services, as well as the contracts, resources, and transactions associated with them. As the firm makes repositioning moves to co-evolve with the competitive landscape, the reconfiguration quest seeks to increase the firm's agility in disintegrating its existing nexus of contracts, resources, and transactions that support the old positions and in reconfiguring new ones that support the new positions. Finally, we revise the sustained competitive advantage quest to propose a renewal quest that recognizes the temporary nature of competitive advantage in CABS. The renewal quest seeks to destabilize the firm's old sources of competitive advantage when competitive dynamics erode their utility, rapidly create new sources of competitive advantage, and concatenate a series of temporary advantages over time. The three reframed quests provide the foundation for a research agenda on IS strategy in CABS.",11/18/2010,10/15/2015 15:14,822-834,,4,21,,Information Systems Research,,,,,,,,,,,,,pubsonline.informs.org (Atypon),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Partisans in both research and practice argue for and against plan-based (allegedly inflexible) and agile (allegedly too flexible) approaches. The stakes in this debate are high; questions raised about plan-based approaches undermine longstanding claims that those approaches, when realized, represent maturity of practice. In this commentary, we call for research programs that will move beyond partisan disagreement to a more nuanced discussion, one that takes into account both benefits and costs of flexibility. Key to such programs will be the development of a robust contingency framework for deciding when (in what conditions) plan-based and agile methods should be used. We develop a basic contingency framework in this paper, one that models the benefit/cost economics described in narratives about the transition from craft to industrial production of physical products. We use this framework to demonstrate the power of even a simple model to help us accomplish three objectives: (1) to refocus discussions about the appropriate design of software development processes, concentrating on when to use particular approaches and how they might be usefully combined; (2) to suggest and guide a trajectory of research that can support and enrich this discussion; and (3) to suggest a technology-based explanation for the emergence of agile development at this point in history. Although we are not the first to argue in favor of a contingency perspective, we show that there remain many opportunities for information systems (IS) research to have a major impact on practice in this area.",9/1/2009,11/19/2015 3:32,462-477,,3,20,,Information Systems Research,Research Commentary�Weighing the Benefits and Costs of Flexibility in Making Software,,,,,,,,,,,,pubsonline.informs.org (Atypon),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Culture also plays a role in managerial processes that may directly, or indirectly, influence IT. Culture is a challenging variable to research, in part because of the multiple divergent definitions and measures of culture. Notwithstanding, a wide body of literature has emerged that sheds light on the relationship of IT and culture. This paper sets out to provide a review of this literature in order to lend insights into our understanding of the linkages between IT and culture. We begin by conceptualizing culture and laying the groundwork for a values-based approach to the examination of IT and culture. Using this approach, we then provide a comprehensive review of the organizational and cross-cultural IT literature that conceptually links these two traditionally separate streams of research. From our analysis, we develop six themes of IT-culture research emphasizing culture's impact on IT, IT's impact on culture, and IT culture. Building upon these themes, we then develop a theory of IT, values, and conflict. Based upon the theory, we develop propositions concerning three types of cultural conflict and the results of these conflicts. Ultimately, the theory suggests that the reconciliation of these conflicts results in a reorientation of values. We conclude with the particular research challenges posed in this line of inquiry.",2006-06,1/19/2016 3:07,357-399,,2,30,,MIS Quarterly,Review,,,,,,,,,,,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A review of the literature reveals that studies examining the association between information technology and organizational performance are divergent in how they conceptualize key constructs and their interrelationships. We develop a model of IT business value based on the resource-based view of the firm that integrates the various strands of research into a single framework. We apply the integrative model to synthesize what is known about IT business value and guide future research by developing propositions and suggesting a research agenda. A principal finding is that IT is valuable, but the extent and dimensions are dependent upon internal and external factors, including complementary organizational resources of the firm and its trading partners, as well as the competitive and macro environment. Our analysis provides a blueprint to guide future research and facilitate knowledge accumulation and creation concerning the organizational performance impacts of information technology.

In this article, we formally define the notion of IT-dependent strategic initiative and use it to frame a review of the literature on the sustain- ability of competitive advantage rooted in information systems use. We offer a framework that articulates both the dynamic approach to IT-dependent strategic advantage currently receiving attention in the literature and the underlying drivers of sustainability. This framework models how and why the characteristics of the IT-dependent strategic initiative enable sustained competitive advantage, and how the determinants of sustainability are developed and strengthened over time. Such explanation facilitates the pre-implementation analysis of planned initiatives by innovators, as well as the post-implementation evaluation of existing initiatives so as to identify the basis of their sustainability. In carrying out this study, we examined the interdisciplinary literature on strategic information systems. Using a structured methodology, we reviewed the titles and abstracts of 648 articles drawn from information systems, strategic management, and marketing literature. We then examined and individually coded a relevant subset of 117 articles. The literature has identified four barriers to erosion of competitive advantage for IT-dependent strategic initiatives and has surfaced the structural determinants of their magnitude. Previous work has also begun to theorize about the process by which these barriers to erosion evolve over time. Our review reveals that significant exploratory research and theoretical development have occurred in this area, but there is a paucity of research providing rigorous tests of theoretical propositions. Our work makes three principal contributions. First, it formalizes the definition of IT-dependent strategic initiative. Second, it organizes the extant interdisciplinary research around an integrative framework that should prove useful to both research and practice. This framework offers an explanation of how and why IT-dependent strategic initiatives contribute to sustained competitive advantage, and explains the process by which they evolve over time.

In the past few years, however, there has been a growing interest in treating knowledge as a significant organizational resource. Consistent with the interest in organizational knowledge and knowledge management (KM), IS researchers have begun promoting a class of information systems, referred to as knowledge management systems (KMS). The objective of KMS is to support creation, transfer, and application of knowledge in organizations. Knowledge and knowledge management are complex and multi-faceted concepts. Thus, effective development and implementation of KMS requires a foundation in several rich literatures. To be credible, KMS research and development should preserve and build upon the significant literature that exists in different but rzelated fields. This paper provides a review and interpretation of knowledge management literatures in different fields with an eye toward identifying the important areas for research.

The analysis of the search results showed that social media constitute a substantial part of the search results, indicating that search engines likely direct travelers to social media sites. This study confirms the growing importance of social media in the online tourism domain. It also provides evidence for challenges faced by traditional providers of travel-related information. Implications for tourism marketers in terms of online marketing strategies are discussed.",2010-04,9/30/2015 20:32,179-188,,2,31,,Tourism Management,,,,,,,,,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nonaka, Toyama and Konno start from the view of an organisation as an entity that creates knowledge continuously, and their goal in this article is to understand the dynamic process in which an organisation creates, maintains and exploits knowledge. They propose a model of knowledge creation consisting of three elements: (i) the SECI process, knowledge creation through the conversion of tacit and explicit knowledge; (ii) �ba�, the shared context for knowledge creation; and (iii) knowledge assets, the inputs, outputs and moderators of the knowledge-creating process. The knowledge creation process is a spiral that grows out of these three elements; the key to leading it is dialectical thinking. The role of top management in articulating the organisation's knowledge vision is emphasised, as is the important role of middle management (�knowledge producers�) in energising ba. In summary, using existing knowledge assets, an organisation creates new knowledge through the SECI process that takes place in ba, where new knowledge, once created, becomes in turn the basis for a new spiral of knowledge creation.",2/1/2000,11/13/2015 3:58,May-34,,1,33,,Long Range Planning,"SECI, Ba and Leadership",,,,,,,,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accordingly, we need to change the way we examine how information technology (IT) can help organizations build a strategic advantage in turbulent environments. We propose a more systemic and holistic perspective to theory building and testing in the information system (IS) strategy area and correspondingly appropriate methods that capture the complexity of this phenomenon. We term this phenomenon digital ecodynamics, defined as the holistic confluence among environmental turbulence, dynamic capabilities, and IT systems � and their fused dynamic interactions unfolding as an ecosystem. We believe that a more holistic understanding of digital ecodynamics will fuel the next leap in knowledge in the IS strategy area.First, extending the strategic management literature that has mainly focused on two-way interactions between environmental turbulence and dynamic capabilities, we foreground IT systems as a third central element. We use a �threesome tango� analogy1 with strong mutual interdependence to accentuate our view of digital ecodynamics � while also stressing the emerging role of IT systems in triggering environmental turbulence and shaping dynamic capabilities to build a strategic advantage. Second, we propose a different paradigmatic lens (configuration theories) as an appropriate inquiring system to better understand the complexity of digital ecodynamics. The paper articulates the key aspects of configuration theories as inquiring systems, compares them with the more common variance theories and process theories, and illustrates the power of recent advances in configurational methods. Third, we create a preliminary roadmap for IS researchers to better examine digital ecodynamics using novel structural properties afforded by configuration theories (i.e., mutual causality, discontinuity, punctuated equilibria, nonlinear change). Fourth, we reflect on the broader opportunities that the configurational perspective of digital ecodynamics can create for IS strategy research. The paper ends by highlighting the double-barreled opportunity that digital ecodynamics renders, both as an energizing vision for IS strategy research and also as a reshaper of strategic management research and practice in a turbulent and digitized world.",7/1/2010,10/20/2015 2:56,,,,,,,Seeking the Configurations of Digital Ecodynamics,,,,,Social Science Research Network,"Rochester, NY",,,SSRN Scholarly Paper,,,papers.ssrn.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SEM precepts influence thought patterns, actions, and emotional arousal. In causal tests, the higher the level of induced self-efficacy, the higher the performance accomplishments and the lower the emotional arousal. The different lines of research reviewed show that the SEM may have wide explanatory power. Perceived self-efficacy helps to account for such diverse phenomena as changes in coping behavior produced by different modes of influence, level of physiological stress reactions, self-regulation of refractory behavior, resignation and despondency to failure experiences, self-debilitating effects of proxy control and illusory inefficaciousness, achievement strivings, growth of intrinsic interest, and career pursuits. The influential role of perceived collective efficacy in social change and the social conditions conducive to development of collective inefficacy are analyzed.

We show senior teams to be distinct interpretive communities rather than one homogeneous category of change agents, as typically portrayed in change literature, who at times of center-led strategic change occupy a complex dual recipient/change agent role. By adopting a narrative approach, we show the shared sensemaking of such a team to be impacted by the locally differentiated nature of its interpretive and relational contexts, leading to context specific interpretations of center-led change and locally distinct responses, with consequences for change outcomes. We found that because of their dual role, senior managers construct two sets of interwoven and interacting change narratives which mediate the relationship between the wider organizational change and local change actions. Our analysis reveals how these evaluations of change, accompanied by affect, evolve over time and how they impact action. These findings contribute to existing theories of sensemaking and change by addressing the previously undertheorized relationship between senior management teams� sensemaking and their responses to strategic change.",6/8/2015,4/14/2016 20:58,960-979,,4,26,,Organization Science,,,,,,,,,,,,,pubsonline.informs.org (Atypon),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We then review and integrate existing theory and research, focusing on two key bodies of work. The first explores how sensemaking is accomplished, unpacking the sensemaking process by examining how events become triggers for sensemaking, how intersubjective meaning is created, and the role of action in sensemaking. The second body considers how sensemaking enables the accomplishment of other key organizational processes, such organizational change, learning, and creativity and innovation.

Using accounts of corporate communication professionals who made sense of anomalous circumstances, I analyze how they used metaphorical words and expressions to organize their accounts and to negotiate between their own individual commitments and perceived social expectations. Based on the analysis, I induce that professionals (a) use individual metaphors to align themselves with the expectations of others and to mark particular roles for themselves that strictly meet those expectations (�strategic shifting�) when they perceive the social approval motive as strong; (b) engage in the extended use of a single metaphor to compress a situation into a frame that mediates between individual convictions and others' expectations (�framing�) when they know the views of others but are also strongly motivated to think through a circumstance as part of their professional role or previous commitments; and (c) systematically use a combination of metaphors that are blended and elaborated into a plausible narrative that attributes responsibility and prescribes a course of action (�narration�) when they are in a position (as part of their role) to define a circumstance, are unconstrained by past experiences, and do not directly know the views of others.

By drawing upon recent thinking in the strategy, entrepreneurship, and IT management literatures, this paper uses a multitheoretic lens to argue that information technology investments and capabilities influence firm performance through three significant organizational capabilities (agility, digital options, and entrepreneurial alertness) and strategic processes (capability-building, entrepreneurial action, and coevolutionary adaptation). We also propose that these dynamic capabilities and strategic processes impact the ability of firms to launch many and varied competitive actions and that, in turn, these competitive actions are a significant antecedent of firm performance.

The SmartGPA study uses passive sensing data and self-reports from students' smartphones to understand individual behavioral differences between high and low performers during a single 10-week term. We propose new methods for better understanding study (e.g., study duration) and social (e.g., partying) behavior of a group of undergraduates. We show that there are a number of important behavioral factors automatically inferred from smartphones that significantly correlate with term and cumulative GPA, including time series analysis of activity, conversational interaction, mobility, class attendance, studying, and partying. We propose a simple model based on linear regression with lasso regularization that can accurately predict cumulative GPA. The predicted GPA strongly correlates with the ground truth from students' transcripts (r = 0:81 and p < 0:001) and predicts GPA within �0:179 of the reported grades.

Typically, researchers see such organizational advantage as accruing from the particular capabilities organizations have for creating and sharing knowledge. In this article the authors seek to contribute to this body of work by developing the following arguments: (1) social capital facilitates the creation of new intellectual capital; (2) organizations, as institutional settings, are conducive to the development of high levels of social capital; and (3) it is because of their more dense social capital that firms, within certain limits, have an advantage over markets in creating and sharing intellectual capital. The authors present a model that incorporates this overall argument in the form of a series of hypothesized relationships between different dimensions of social capital and the main mechanisms and processes necessary for the creation of intellectual capital.",1998-04,12/3/2015 3:28,242-266,,2,23,,Academy of Management Review,,,,,,,,,,,,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our results indicate that the social interaction and network ties dimensions of social capital are indeed associated with greater knowledge acquisition, but that the relationship quality dimension is negatively associated with knowledge acquisition. Knowledge acquisition is, in turn, positively associated with knowledge exploitation for competitive advantage through new product development, technological distinctiveness, and sales cost efficiency.

Social contagion acknowledges the mutual influence among organizations within an institutional field and implicates information transmission through direct contact and observation as the mechanisms underlying influence transfer. We propose hypotheses predicting a hospital's likelihood of adopting electronic medical records as a function of its susceptibility to the influence of prior adopters, the infectiousness or potency of influence exerted by adopting hospitals, and its social and spatial proximity to prior adopters. Results obtained by fitting a heterogeneous diffusion model to data from a sample drawn from an annual survey, spanning 1975 to 2005, of almost 4,000 U.S. hospitals suggest that diffusion can be accelerated if specific attention is given to increasing social contagion effects. In particular, with respect to susceptibility to influence, greater hospital size and age are positively related to the likelihood of adoption for nonadopters, whereas younger hospitals are associated with greater infectiousness for adopters. A hospital's ""celebrity"" status also contributes to its infectiousness. We further find strong effects for social proximity and significant regional effects for spatial proximity and hospital size, suggesting that geographical covariates should be included in diffusion studies. Results also reinforce the importance of theorizing about and including interactions in examinations of social contagion.",2010-08,11/1/2015 19:12,1219-1241,,8,56,,Management Science,Social Contagion and Information Technology Diffusion,,,,,,,,,,,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The networked structure of interactions on YouTube and the tremendous variation in the success of videos posted online lends itself to an inquiry of the role of social influence. Using a unique data set of video information and user information collected from YouTube, we find that social interactions are influential not only in determining which videos become successful but also on the magnitude of that impact. We also find evidence for a number of mechanisms by which social influence is transmitted, such as (i) a preference for conformity and homophily and (ii) the role of social networks in guiding opinion formation and directing product search and discovery. Econometrically, the problem in identifying social influence is that individuals' choices depend in great part upon the choices of other individuals, referred to as the reflection problem. Another problem in identification is to distinguish between social contagion and user heterogeneity in the diffusion process. Our results are in sharp contrast to earlier models of diffusion, such as the Bass model, that do not distinguish between different social processes that are responsible for the process of diffusion. Our results are robust to potential self-selection according to user tastes, temporal heterogeneity and the reflection problem.

This has considerable relevance for understanding attempts to manage knowledge in settings where activityand learning are project-based. Knowledge management in such a context faces manychallenges, due to the one-off nature of project work and the manyresulting discontinuities in methods of organisation and flows of personnel, materials and information. One important consequence is that social processes potentiallyplayan important part in the diffusion and transfer of knowledge and learning. This paper sets out to examine the significance of social factors in enhancing knowledge management capabilities in such an environment, drawing upon case studyresearch from the construction industry. The main finding from the research is that processes of knowledge capture, transfer and learning in project settings relyveryheavilyupon social patterns, practices and processes in ways which emphasise the value and importance of adopting a community-based approach to managing knowledge.",2003,5/6/2016 15:46,157-166,,21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results show that formal hierarchical structure, in the form of centralization, has a significant negative effect on knowledge sharing, and informal lateral relations, in the form of social interaction, have a significant positive effect on knowledge sharing among units that compete with each other for market share, but not among units that compete with each other for internal resources.",4/1/2002,7/23/2016 23:34,179-190,,2,13,,Organization Science,Social Structure of �Coopetition� Within a Multiunit Organization,,,,,,,,,,,,pubsonline.informs.org (Atypon),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the one hand, the infrastructure put into place to meet schools� needs can also serve households. On the other hand, students get acquainted with the Internet at school and signal its usefulness to adults at home who, consequently, can be more likely to adopt it. In this paper, we model the roles that broadband use at school and Internet adoption in neighboring households play in the decision to adopt the Internet at home and measure their effects empirically. We use data from Portugal between 2006 and 2009 on household Internet penetration and on how much schools use broadband. We use two different sets of instruments for the schools� broadband use to alleviate endogeneity concerns. Both approaches yield similar results. We find that broadband use at school leads to higher levels of Internet penetration in neighboring households. Broadband use in schools was responsible for a year-over-year increase of 3.5 percentage points on Internet penetration in households with children. Across our data set this effect accounts for about 17% of the increase in home Internet adoption. We also find evidence of regional spillovers in Internet adoption across households. These were roughly responsible for an increase of 2.1 percentage points in Internet penetration or 38% of the total increase in household Internet penetration between 2006 and 2009. These results show that wiring schools with broadband is an effective policy to lower the barriers for Internet adoption at home and as such contributes to accelerating the pace of broadband diffusion.

JERK8T4H,encyclopediaArticle,2016,,Statistics,"Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia",,,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Statistics,"Statistics is the study of the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data. In applying statistics to, e.g., a scientific, industrial, or social problem, it is conventional to begin with a statistical population or a statistical model process to be studied. Populations can be diverse topics such as ""all people living in a country"" or ""every atom composing a crystal"". Statistics deals with all aspects of data including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of surveys and experiments. Some popular definitions are: Merriam-Webster dictionary defines statistics as ""classified facts representing the conditions of a people in a state � especially the facts that can be stated in numbers or any other tabular or classified arrangement"". Statistician Sir Arthur Lyon Bowley defines statistics as ""Numerical statements of facts in any department of inquiry placed in relation to each other"". When census data cannot be collected, statisticians collect data by developing specific experiment designs and survey samples. Representative sampling assures that inferences and conclusions can safely extend from the sample to the population as a whole. An experimental study involves taking measurements of the system under study, manipulating the system, and then taking additional measurements using the same procedure to determine if the manipulation has modified the values of the measurements. In contrast, an observational study does not involve experimental manipulation. Two main statistical methodologies are used in data analysis: descriptive statistics, which summarizes data from a sample using indexes such as the mean or standard deviation, and inferential statistics, which draws conclusions from data that are subject to random variation (e.g., observational errors, sampling variation). Descriptive statistics are most often concerned with two sets of properties of a distribution (sample or population): central tendency (or location) seeks to characterize the distribution's central or typical value, while dispersion (or variability) characterizes the extent to which members of the distribution depart from its center and each other. Inferences on mathematical statistics are made under the framework of probability theory, which deals with the analysis of random phenomena. A standard statistical procedure involves the test of the relationship between two statistical data sets, or a data set and a synthetic data drawn from idealized model. An hypothesis is proposed for the statistical relationship between the two data sets, and this is compared as an alternative to an idealized null hypothesis of no relationship between two data sets. Rejecting or disproving the null hypothesis is done using statistical tests that quantify the sense in which the null can be proven false, given the data that are used in the test. Working from a null hypothesis, two basic forms of error are recognized: Type I errors (null hypothesis is falsely rejected giving a ""false positive"") and Type II errors (null hypothesis fails to be rejected and an actual difference between populations is missed giving a ""false negative""). Multiple problems have come to be associated with this framework: ranging from obtaining a sufficient sample size to specifying an adequate null hypothesis. Measurement processes that generate statistical data are also subject to error. Many of these errors are classified as random (noise) or systematic (bias), but other types of errors (e.g., blunder, such as when an analyst reports incorrect units) can also be important. The presence of missing data and/or censoring may result in biased estimates and specific techniques have been developed to address these problems. Statistics can be said to have begun in ancient civilization, going back at least to the 5th century BC, but it was not until the 18th century that it started to draw more heavily from calculus and probability theory. Statistics continues to be an area of active research, for example on the problem of how to analyze Big data.",7/29/2016,7/29/2016 23:49,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License,,,,Wikipedia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prior research has argued that business-IT strategic alignment facilit�tes business effect of IT and that contextual factors affect business-IT alignment. However, the role of knowledge considerations in the relationship between contextual factors and alignment, and the role of IT projeets in the relationship between alignment and business effects of IT, have not been explicitly examined. Therefore, this paper pursues the following two research questions: (1) Based on knowledge considerations, how do planning behaviors (speeifieally, IT managers' participation in business planning and business managers' participation in IT planning) and top management knowledge of IT mediate the effects of two eontextual factors�organizational emphasis on knowledge management and centralization of IT decisions�on business-IT strategic alignment? (2) How do aspects of IT projeets (specifically, quality of IT project planning and implementation problems in IT projeets) mediate the relationship between business-IT strategic alignment and business effeets of IT? Results from a survey of 274 senior information officers indicate that organizational emphasis on knowledge management and centralization of IT decisions affect top managers' knowledge of IT, which facilitates business managers' participation in strategic IT planning and IT managers' participation in business planning, and both of these planning behaviors affect business-IT strategic alignment. Moreover, the results indicate that quality of IT project planning and implementation problems in IT projeets mediate the relationship between business-IT strategic alignment and business effect of IT. These findings highlight the importance of considering the planning and implementation of IT projeets when examining the effeets of business-IT strategic alignment, and highlight the importance of considering shared domain knowledge (i. e., top managers' knowledge of IT) and planning behaviors when examining the effeets of eontextual factors on business-IT strategic alignment. Managers can use th�se results to develop more comprehensive action plans for achieving greater business-IT strategic alignment, and for translating alignment into enhanced IT effeets on business performance.",2006,2/9/2016 19:02,129-162,,3,23,,Journal of Management Information Systems,Strategic Alignment between Business and Information Technology,,,,,,,,,,,,JSTOR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These issues are not just tough or persistent; they're ""wicked"" -- a label used by urban planners for problems that cannot be definitively resolved. Poverty and terrorism are classic examples. A wicked problem has innumerable causes, morphs constantly, and has no correct answer. It can be tamed, however, with the right approach. In this article, Camillus, a professor at the Katz Graduate School of Business, explains how executives can tell if they're dealing with a wicked strategy problem. In a 15 year study involving 22 companies, he identified five key criteria. If a problem involves many stakeholders with conflicting priorities; if its roots are tangled; if it changes with every attempt to address it; if you've never faced it before; and if there's no way to evaluate whether a remedy will work, chances are good that it's wicked. According to the author, the need for faster growth is, in all likelihood, a wicked issue for Wal-Mart. Traditional linear processes -- identifying the issue, gathering data, studying all the options, choosing one strategy -- don't work with wicked problems. They instead demand social processes that constantly engage stakeholders, explore related issues, reevaluate the problem's definition, and reconsider the assumptions of stakeholders. A strong corporate identity is essential: It serves as a rudder that helps the enterprise navigate a sea of choices. Because it's impossible to tell which options are appropriate, executives should stop analyzing them and start experimenting with actions. Eventually they will make progress by muddling through. Envisioning possible futures and identifying moves that will realize the one the company hopes for will uncover promising remedies. That's how PPG Industries, a 100-year-old manufacturer, has successfully coped with its wicked strategy issues.",2008-05,10/16/2015 18:17,98-106,,5,86,,Harvard Business Review,,,,,,,,,,,,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Competitive behavior can be understood in terms of player access to ""holes"" in the social structure of the competitive arena. Those ""structural holes"" are network gaps  between players which create entrepreneurial opportunities for information access, timing, referrals, and for control.        A player brings capital to the competitive arena and walks away with profit determined by the rate of return where the capital was invested. The rate of return is keyed to the social structure of the competitive arena. Each player brings three kinds of capital to the competitive arena: financial capital, such as money and investments; human capital, such as his or her natural qualities and skills; and social capital, i.e. networks of other players. Social capital is the final determinant of competitive success. Something  about the structure of a player's network (his or her relations with other players, such as colleagues, friends, and clients), and the location of the player's network in the structure of the arena defines the player's chances of getting higher rates of return. These chances are enhanced by two kinds of network benefits for those who can exploit structural holes: information and control.        Opportunities for success are many, but it is information that plays a central role in seizing them; structural holes determine who knows about opportunities, what they know, and who gets to participate. Structural holes also generate control benefits, giving certain players an advantage in negotiating their relationships. Following sociological theory, a player who derives benefit from structural holes by brokering relationships between other conflicted players is called tertius gaudens. The essential tension in tertius strategies is not hostility of participants, but rather uncertainty; no one has absolute authority in the relationship under negotiation.                 The findings of empirical research indicate that structural holes are advantageous to suppliers and customers, but not to producers in their negotiated transactions, because suppliers and customers benefit from competition among producers. The information and control benefits of structural holes are advantageous to managers, and the managers who develop those benefits are an asset to the firm employing them. Managers with networks rich in structural holes often reach promotion faster. Hole effects are most evident for managers operating on a social frontier, i.e. in places where two social worlds meet. Social frontiers involve continual negotiations of the expectations of the manager and those of the people across the frontier, and thus more entrepreneurial skill is required.                  The most serious frontier is the political boundary between top leadership and the rest of the firm. To move up the corporate ladder, a manager has to transform his or her frame of reference from that of an employee protected by the firm, to that of a leader responsible for the firm. The findings also indicate that women and entry-rank men tend to be promoted earlier because they build hierarchical networks around a strategic partner who helps them break into higher ranks. Although the reported differences between the manager networks have clear implications for promotions, there are no differences among managers in their tendencies to have one network rather than another, which is especially striking  with respect to the sex and rank differences  that are observed to be important in distinguishing network effects.                 Structural holes provide a theoretical connection between micro and macro levels of sociological analysis. The structural hole argument extends other theories, such as personality theory, interface theory of markets and population ecology, and resource dependence and transaction cost theory",1992,10/30/2015 5:02,,,,,,,Structural Holes,,,,,Social Science Research Network,"Rochester, NY",,,SSRN Scholarly Paper,,,papers.ssrn.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We believe that a single research perspective for studying information systems phenomena is unnecessarily restrictive, and argue that there exist other philosophical assumptions that can inform studies of the relationships between information technology, people, and organizations. In this paper, we present two additional research philosophies for consideration-the interpretive and the critical-and for each we provide empirical examples to illustrate how they are used.

We define style composition as the activity through which authors select, emphasize, and present elements of their research to establish premises, develop inferences, and present contributions in publications. Drawing on this general notion, we identify a set of styles that is characteristic of how IS action researchers compose their argument. Premise styles relate to the dual goals of action research through practical or theoretical positioning of the argument; inference styles combine insights from the problem-solving and the research cycles through inductive or deductive reasoning; and contribution styles focus on different types of contributions-experience report, field study, theoretical development, problem solving method, and research method. Based on the considered sample, we analyze the styles adopted in selected publications and show that authors have favored certain styles while leaving others under explored;further, we reveal important strengths and weaknesses in the composition of styles within the IS discipline. Based on these insights, we discuss how action research practices and writing can be improved, as well as how to further develop style compositions to support the publication of engaged scholarship research",2012-06,7/19/2016 19:02,347-363,,2,36,,MIS Quarterly,,,,,,,,,,,,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The focus on subsidiaries is especially interesting since they are simultaneously embedded in two knowledge contexts: (a) the internal multinational corporation (MNC) comprised of the headquarters and other subsidiaries; and (b) an external environment of regional or host country firms. We develop hypotheses to suggest that the extent of influences of these contexts on subsidiary technological innovation depends on the characteristics of the knowledge network (technological richness and diversity) and the knowledge linkages of the subsidiary with other entities. The study uses patent citation data pertaining to innovations by foreign subsidiaries of U.S. semiconductor firms to test these hypotheses. The paper finds that (a) the technological richness of the MNC, (b) the subsidiary's knowledge linkages to host country firms, and (c) the technological diversity within the host country have a positive impact on innovation.

Recently, scholars have raised several issues regarding the understanding of tacit knowledge as well as the interaction between tacit and explicit knowledge in the theory. The purpose of this article is to introduce and comment on the debate about organizational knowledge creation theory.

The research reported in this study has two primary objectives: (1) to propose a comprehensive theoretical model that incorporates valuable insights from two comple mentary streams of research, and (2) to empirically test the core of the model. At the heart of the new model is the assertion that for an information technology to have a positive impact on individual performance, the technology: (1) must be utilized and (2) must be a good fit with the tasks it supports. This new model is moderately supported by an analysis of data from over 600 individuals in two companies. This research highlights the importance of the fit between technologies and users' tasks in achieving individual performance impacts from information technology. It also suggests that task-technology fit, when decomposed into its more detailed components, could be the basis for a strong diagnostic tool to evaluate whether information systems and services in a given organization are meeting user needs.",6/1/1995,9/16/2015 17:20,213-236,,2,19,,MIS Quarterly,,,,,,,,,"Copyright � 1995 Management Information Systems Research Center, University of Minnesota",,,,JSTOR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How and why is teamwork related to the success of innovative projects? How strong is the relationship between teamwork and various measures of project success such as performance or team member satisfaction? This article develops a comprehensive concept of the collaboration in teams, called Teamwork Quality. The 6 facets of the TWQ construct, i.e., communication, coordination, balance of member contributions, mutual support, effort, and cohesion, are specified. Hypotheses regarding the relationship between TWQ and project success are tested using data from 575 team members, team leaders, and managers of 145 German software teams. The results of the structural equation models estimated show that TWQ (as rated by team members) is significantly associated with team performance as rated by team members, team leaders, and team-external managers. However, the magnitude of the relationship between TWQ and team performance varies by the perspective of the performance rater, i.e., manager vs. team leader vs. team members. Furthermore, TWQ shows a strong association with team members' personal success (i.e., work satisfaction and learning).",2001-08,5/1/2016 0:43,435-449,,4,12,,,Teamwork quality and the success of innovative projects,,,,,,,English,Copyright Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences Jul/Aug 2001,,,,ProQuest,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This research draws on the analytic concept of technology frames of reference to develop a socio-cognitive process model of how frames and shifts in frame salience influence sensemaking during requirements determination. The model provides a theoretical and conceptual perspective that deepens understanding of requirements processes in organizations and of the socio-cognitive basis of power in ISD. This paper reports on a longitudinal case study, in which four technology frame domains were identified and the influence of frames on project participants' understanding of requirements was traced through eight RD episodes. Repeated shifts in the salience of the business value of IT and IT delivery strategies frames disrupted project participants' understanding of requirements and contributed to a turbulent RD process. Analysis of frames and framing helped explain how interpretive power was exercised, yet constrained, in this project.

The current trust in technology literature employs two different types of trust in technology constructs. Some researchers use human-like trust constructs (e.g., benevolence, integrity, and ability), while other researchers use system-like trust constructs (e.g., helpfulness, reliability, and functionality). Interestingly, past research shows that both sets of measures influence important dependent variables, but the literature does not explain when one type should be used instead of the other type. In this paper, we use trust, social presence, and affordance theories to shed light on this research problem. We report on two studies. In study 1, we argue first that technologies vary in their perceived �humanness�. Second, we argue that, because users perceive two technologies to differ in humanness, they will develop trust in each technology differently (i.e., along more human-like criteria or more system-like criteria). We study two technologies that vary in humanness to explore these differences theoretically and empirically. We demonstrate that, when the trust construct used aligns well with how human the technology is, it produces stronger effects on selected outcome variables than does a misaligned trust construct. In study 2, we assess whether these technologies differ in humanness based on social presence, social affordances, and affordances for sociality.

In a comparison of five strategy projects, we observed that organizational participants struggled with competing interpretations of what might emerge in the future, what was currently at stake, and even what had happened in the past. We develop a model of temporal work in strategy making that articulates how actors resolved differences and linked their interpretations of the past, present, and future so as to construct a strategic account that enabled concrete strategic choice and action. We found that settling on a particular account required it to be coherent, plausible, and acceptable; otherwise, breakdowns resulted. Such breakdowns could impede progress, but they could also be generative in provoking a search for new interpretations and possibilities for action. The more intensely actors engaged in temporal work, the more likely the strategies departed from the status quo. Our model suggests that strategy cannot be understood as the product of more or less accurate forecasting without considering the multiple interpretations of present concerns and historical trajectories that help to constitute those forecasts. Projections of the future are always entangled with views of the past and present, and temporal work is the means by which actors construct and reconstruct the connections among them. These insights into the mechanisms of strategy making help explain the practices and conditions that produce organizational inertia and change.",12/20/2012,4/14/2016 3:02,965-995,,4,24,,Organization Science,,,,,,,,,,,,,pubsonline.informs.org.ezproxy.baylor.edu (Atypon),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that knowledge professionals using mobile email devices to manage their communication were enacting a norm of continual connectivity and accessibility that produced a number of contradictory outcomes. Although individual use of mobile email devices offered these professionals flexibility, peace of mind, and control over interactions in the short term, it also intensified collective expectations of their availability, escalating their engagement and thus reducing their ability to disconnect from work. Choosing to use their mobile email devices to work anywhere/anytime�actions they framed as evidence of their personal autonomy�the professionals were ending up using it everywhere/all the time, thus diminishing their autonomy in practice. This autonomy paradoxreflected professionals� ongoing navigation of the tension between their interests in personal autonomy on the one hand and their professional commitment to colleagues and clients on the other.

The vast majority of research by psychologists on the effects of �gaming� has been on its negative impact: the potential harm related to violence, addiction, and depression. We recognize the value of that research; however, we argue that a more balanced perspective is needed, one that considers not only the possible negative effects but also the benefits of playing these games. Considering these potential benefits is important, in part, because the nature of these games has changed dramatically in the last decade, becoming increasingly complex, diverse, realistic, and social in nature. A small but significant body of research has begun to emerge, mostly in the last five years, documenting these benefits. In this article, we summarize the research on the positive effects of playing video games, focusing on four main domains: cognitive, motivational, emotional, and social. By integrating insights from developmental, positive, and social psychology, as well as media psychology, we propose some candidate mechanisms by which playing video games may foster real-world psychosocial benefits. Our aim is to provide strong enough evidence and a theoretical rationale to inspire new programs of research on the largely unexplored mental health benefits of gaming. Finally, we end with a call to intervention researchers and practitioners to test the positive uses of video games, and we suggest several promising directions for doing so.

Drawing on actor-network theory, we conducted a 3-year study to investigate the evolution of the Internet TV initiative in LaGrange, Georgia, in the United States. The results reveal distinct interpretations of the initiative by different actor groups (the government, the service providers, socioeconomically advantaged residents, and socioeconomically disadvantaged residents), at different stages of implementation, pointing to tensions among the various groups. These tensions reflect the structural problems embedded in the macro political, economic, and societal context.

In this paper, we examine efforts undertaken by two cities � Atlanta and LaGrange, Georgia � to redress the digital divide. Atlanta's initiative has taken the form of community technology centres where citizens can come to get exposure to the internet, and learn something about computers and their applications. LaGrange has taken a very different approach, providing free internet access to the home via a digital cable set-top box. Using theoretical constructs from Bourdieu, we analysed how the target populations and service providers reacted to the two initiatives, how these reactions served to reproduce the digital divide, and the lessons for future digital divide initiatives. In our findings and analysis, we see a reinforcement of the status quo. When people embrace these initiatives, they are full of enthusiasm, and there is no question that some learning occurs and that the programmes are beneficial. However, there is no mechanism for people to go to the next step, whether that is technical certification, going to college, buying a personal computer or escaping the poverty that put them on the losing end of the divide in the first place. This leads us to conclude that the Atlanta and LaGrange programmes could be classified as successes in the sense that they provided access and basic computer literacy to people lacking these resources. However, both programmes were, at least initially, conceived rather narrowly and represent short-term, technology-centric fixes to a problem that is deeply rooted in long-standing and systemic patterns of spatial, political and economic disadvantage. A persistent divide exists even when cities are giving away theoretically �free� goods and services.",1/1/2006,2/18/2016 22:52,23-53,,1,16,,,The challenges of redressing the digital divide,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little systematic study has examined the variation in firm decisions to adopt the Internet. I explore the sources of this variation by examining Internet adoption decisions in a very large sample of organizations in the finance and services sector in 1998. I show how prior information technology (IT) investments and workplace organization decisions affect the returns to adopting simple and complex Internet technologies. I show that recent investments in client/server (C/S) networking applications have competing effects on the likelihood of Internet adoption. Such investments can slow adoption by acting as a short-run substitute or by creating ""switching costs."" Geographic dispersion of employees is complementary with Internet adoption, suggesting that Internet technology lowered internal coordination costs.

98X8E7KR,book,2003,"Booth, Wayne C.; Colomb, Gregory G.; Williams, Joseph M.","The Craft of Research, 2nd Edition",,978-0-226-06568-7,,,,"Since 1995, more than 150,000 students and researchers have turned to The Craft of Research for clear and helpful guidance on how to conduct research and report it effectively . Now, master teachers Wayne C. Booth, Gregory G. Colomb, and Joseph M. Williams present a completely revised and updated version of their classic handbook.Like its predecessor, this new edition reflects the way researchers actually work: in a complex circuit of thinking, writing, revising, and rethinking. It shows how each part of this process influences the others and how a successful research report is an orchestrated conversation between a researcher and a reader. Along with many other topics, The Craft of Research explains how to build an argument that motivates readers to accept a claim; how to anticipate the reservations of thoughtful yet critical readers and to respond to them appropriately; and how to create introductions and conclusions that answer that most demanding question, ""So what?""Celebrated by reviewers for its logic and clarity, this popular book retains its five-part structure. Part 1 provides an orientation to the research process and begins the discussion of what motivates researchers and their readers. Part 2 focuses on finding a topic, planning the project, and locating appropriate sources. This section is brought up to date with new information on the role of the Internet in research, including how to find and evaluate sources, avoid their misuse, and test their reliability. Part 3 explains the art of making an argument and supporting it. The authors have extensively revised this section to present the structure of an argument in clearer and more accessible terms than in the first edition. New distinctions are made among reasons, evidence, and reports of evidence. The concepts of qualifications and rebuttals are recast as acknowledgment and response. Part 4 covers drafting and revising, and offers new information on the visual representation of data. Part 5 concludes the book with an updated discussion of the ethics of research, as well as an expanded bibliography that includes many electronic sources. The new edition retains the accessibility, insights, and directness that have made The Craft of Research an indispensable guide for anyone doing research, from students in high school through advanced graduate study to businesspeople and government employees. The authors demonstrate convincingly that researching and reporting skills can be learned and used by all who undertake research projects.New to this edition:Extensive coverage of how to do research on the internet, including how to evaluate and test the reliability of sourcesNew information on the visual representation of dataExpanded bibliography with many electronic sources",4/14/2003,,,350,,,,,,,,,,University of Chicago Press,,en,,,,,Google Books,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To this end, researchers have based their assumptions and theories on the technological achievements and perceptions of technology at that time. Ever since the introduction of smart phones, broadband Internet, and social networks, much has changed in the way we perceive and appropriate IT value. In order to identify possible white spots for future research, we present a systematic literature review of the past 10 years of research in this area. In doing so, we develop a taxonomy for analyzing the IT value literature. The results of our analysis indicate that the majority of current work focuses on ex post measurement of the monetary value of IT for businesses. Only a few articles were found that employed an alternative lens in defining IT value. With the blurring boundaries between private and professional life, these approaches become increasingly more important. We discuss the general implications of our findings with a view to possible new themes for the next years of research.",2015,2/20/2016 0:41,,,,,,,The Current State of and Possible Future Avenues for IT Value Research,,,,,European Conference for Information Systems,M�nster,,,,,,Google Scholar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The extent and the nature of this divide depend on the kind of access defined. Considering the possession of hardware, growing divides among different categories of income, employment, education, age, and ethnicity can be proved to have existed in the 1980s and 1990s according to official American and Dutch statistics. If only by effects of saturation, these gaps will more or less close. However, it is shown that differential access of skills and usage is likely to increase. The growth of a usage gap is projected. Multivariate analyses of Dutch official statistics reveal the striking effect of age and gender as compared to education. The usage gap is related to the evolution of the information and network society.

Some people consider the Digital Divide to be a national crisis, while others consider it an over-hyped nonissue. This book presents data supporting the existence of such a divide in the 1990s along racial, economic, ethnic, and education lines. But it also presents evidence that by 2000 the gaps are rapidly closing without substantive public policy initiatives and spending.

Early research studies assumed technology to be an objective, external force that would have deterministic impacts on organizational properties such as structure. Later researchers focused on the human aspect of technology, seeing it as the outcome of strategic choice and social action. This paper suggests that either view is incomplete, and proposes a reconceptualization of technology that takes both perspectives into account. A theoretical model-the structurational model of technology-is built on the basis of this new conceptualization, and its workings explored through discussion of a field study of information technology. The paper suggests that the reformulation of the technology concept and the structurational model of technology allow a deeper and more dialectical understanding of the interaction between technology and organizations. This understanding provides insight into the limits and opportunities of human choice, technology development and use, and organizational design. Implications for future research of the new concept of technology and the structurational model of technology are discussed.",8/1/1992,9/30/2015 17:18,398-427,,3,3,,Organization Science,The Duality of Technology,,,,,,,,Copyright � 1992 INFORMS,,,,JSTOR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the focus of prior research has been on training and individual self-efficacy as important enablers, we examine the roles that the social network structures of employees, and the organizational units where they work, play in influencing the postimplementation success. Data were gathered across several units within a large organization: immediately after the implementation, six months after the implementation, and one year after the implementation. Social network analysis was used to understand the effects of network structures, and hierarchical linear modeling was used to capture the multilevel effects at unit and individual levels. At the unit level of analysis, we found that centralized structures inhibit implementation success. At the individual level of analysis, employees with high in-degree and betweenness centrality reported high task impact and information quality. We also found a cross-level effect such that central employees in centralized units reported implementation success. This suggests that individual-level success can occur even within a unit structure that is detrimental to unit-level success.

Within organizations, IS habits may develop over long periods of time and are typically embedded within larger, frequently practiced, higher-level work routines or task sequences. When new systems are introduced for the purpose of at least partially replacing incumbent systems, existing IS habits embedded in these routines may inhibit adoption and use of the new systems. Therefore, understanding how work-related IS habits form, how they enable and inhibit behavior, and how they can be disrupted or encouraged requires that we examine them within the context of organizational and individual level work routines. The current study integrates psychology and organizational behavior literature on cognitive scripts and work routines to examine IS habits as they occur embedded within larger, more complex task sequences. The objective of the paper is to contribute to the IS habit literature by (1) situating IS habits within the context of their associated work routines and task sequences, and (2) providing a theoretical understanding of how incumbent system habits can be disrupted, and how development of new system habits can be encouraged, within this context. We draw from extant research in psychology, organizational behavior, and consumer behavior to offer propositions about context-focused organizational interventions to break, or otherwise discourage, the continued performance of incumbent system habits and to encourage the development of new system habits. Specifically, our theoretical development includes script disruption techniques, training-in-context, and performance goal suspension as organizational interventions that disrupt incumbent system habits. We further theorize how stabilizing contextual variables associated with modified work routines can facilitate the development of new system habits. The paper concludes by discussing the importance of combining intervention strategies to successfully disrupt incumbent system habits and encourage development of new system habits and thus facilitate adoption of new systems",2013-03,12/3/2015 21:40,221-246,,1,37,,MIS Quarterly,The Embeddedness of Information Systems Habits in Organizational and Individual Level Routines,,,,,,,,,,,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Through Ellis's interactions with her students, you are given useful strategies for conducting a study, including the need for introspection, the struggles of the budding ethnographic writer, the practical problems in explaining results of this method to outsiders, and the moral and ethical issues that get raised in this intimate form of research.

The ability to identify challenges, spot opportunities, and adapt with agility is not just a competitive advantage but also a requirement for survival. People have long preached the benefits of relying on data and insights from business intelligence (BI) and analytics to help make better and timelier decisions. A reliance on data from these tools was expected to deliver better financial performance. A global survey of 646 executives, managers, and professionals across all industries and geographies reveals a significant, albeit subtle, change in decision-making processes and their use of these analytics/BI tools.",2012,2/21/2016,,,,,,,,,,,Harvard Business Review Analytic Services Report,Harvard Business School Publishing,"Boston, MA USA",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its result is now often called the knowledge economy. But what are the historical origins of this revolution and what have been its mechanisms? In The Gifts of Athena, Joel Mokyr constructs an original framework to analyze the concept of ""useful"" knowledge. He argues that the growth explosion in the modern West in the past two centuries was driven not just by the appearance of new technological ideas but also by the improved access to these ideas in society at large--as made possible by social networks comprising universities, publishers, professional sciences, and kindred institutions. Through a wealth of historical evidence set in clear and lively prose, he shows that changes in the intellectual and social environment and the institutional background in which knowledge was generated and disseminated brought about the Industrial Revolution, followed by sustained economic growth and continuing technological change.  Mokyr draws a link between intellectual forces such as the European enlightenment and subsequent economic changes of the nineteenth century, and follows their development into the twentieth century. He further explores some of the key implications of the knowledge revolution. Among these is the rise and fall of the ""factory system"" as an organizing principle of modern economic organization. He analyzes the impact of this revolution on information technology and communications as well as on the public's state of health and the structure of households. By examining the social and political roots of resistance to new knowledge, Mokyr also links growth in knowledge to political economy and connects the economic history of technology to the New Institutional Economics. The Gifts of Athena provides crucial insights into a matter of fundamental concern to a range of disciplines including economics, economic history, political economy, the history of technology, and the history of science.",2002,,,396,,,,,The Gifts of Athena,,,,,Princeton University Press,,en,,,,,Google Books,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because the benefits of educational investments are seen only in the future, it is possible to underestimate the value and the importance of improvements. This report uses recent economic modelling to relate cognitive skills--as measured by PISA and other international instruments--to economic growth. This relationship indicates that relatively small improvements in the skills of a nation's labour force can have very large impacts on future well-being. The second section of this report describes analyses of human capital and economic growth. It provides a short review of alternative models of economic growth and links these to the progression of empirical analysis. From this, it summarises the best evidence on how cognitive skills affect economic growth. The third section then presents a series of simulations for OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) countries of various amounts of improvement in cognitive skills. The fourth section concludes and discusses some of the political-economy issues involved. Technical issues, including the development of measures of cognitive skills and the underlying statistical modelling, are presented in annexes. (Contains 8 tables, 11 figures, 2 boxes, and 35 notes.)

The firm operates under a capital budget for financing the capacity investment, and an operating budget, which is uncertain in the capacity investment stage, for financing the production. We investigate how the tightening of the capital budget and a lower financial flexibility in the production stage (the likelihood of having a sufficient operating budget) shape the optimal technology choice. We find that the dominant regime is one where dedicated technology should be adopted for a larger investment cost range, and thus, is the best response to the tighter capital budget, whereas flexible technology is the best response to lower financial flexibility. We identify the key roles that the capacity intensity (the ratio of unit capacity cost to total unit capacity and production cost) of each technology and the pooling value of operating budget with dedicated technology, which brings this technology closer to flexible technology in terms of the resource network�s flexibility, play in a budget-constrained environment. Managerially, our results underline that in the presence of financial constraints, firms should manage technology adoption together with plant location, which shapes capacity intensity, or product portfolio, which shapes financial flexibility.

Using a computational model, we examine when it is beneficial to create production knowledge within a central unit, the �lead factory,� and transfer it to geographically dispersed plants. We demonstrate that the knowledge transfer generates a trade-off between a positive cost-saving effect due to fewer adaptations in each plant, and a negative transfer cost effect due to the costly knowledge transfer itself. The complexity of the production process moderates the performance implications of the knowledge transfer because it determines the relative strength of these two effects. For production processes with low complexity, knowledge transfer can engender superior network performance. Here, an optimal extent of knowledge transfer exists, and thus, a complete knowledge transfer is not performance maximizing. For production processes with medium and high levels of complexity, performance is reduced rather than enhanced through knowledge transfer so that it is optimal not to transfer any knowledge from the lead factory to the plants. While we analyze knowledge transfer within a manufacturing network, our results are transferable to other settings that consist of a knowledge sending and receiving unit.",11/1/2014,8/4/2016 2:00,1886-1898,,11,23,,Prod Oper Manag,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The model is based on the idea that the tenets of the OSS ideology motivate behaviors that enhance cognitive trust and communication quality and encourage identification with the project team, which enhances affective trust. Trust and communication in turn impact OSS team effectiveness. The research considers two kinds of effectiveness in OSS teams: the attraction and retention of developer input and the generation of project outputs. Hypotheses regarding antecedents to each are developed. Hypotheses are tested using survey and objective data on OSS projects. Results support the main thesis that OSS team members' adherence to the tenets of the OSS community ideology impacts OSS team effectiveness and reveal that different components impact effectiveness in different ways. Of particular interest is the finding that adherence to some ideological components was beneficial to the effectiveness of the team in terms of attracting and retaining input, but detrimental to the output of the team.

Building consumer trust is a strategic imperative for web-based vendors because trust strongly influences consumer intentions to transact with unfamiliar vendors via the web. Trust allows consumers to overcome perceptions of risk and uncertainty, and to engage in the following three behaviors that are critical to the realization of a web-based vendor's strategic objectives: following advice offered by the web vendor, sharing personal information with the vendor, and purchasing from the vendor's web site. Trust in the vendor is defined as a multi-dimensional construct with two inter-related components�trusting beliefs (perceptions of the competence, benevolence, and integrity of the vendor), and trusting intentions�willingness to depend (that is, a decision to make oneself vulnerable to the vendor). Three factors are proposed for building consumer trust in the vendor: structural assurance (that is, consumer perceptions of the safety of the web environment), perceived web vendor reputation, and perceived web site quality. The model is tested in the context of a hypothetical web site offering legal advice. All three factors significantly influenced consumer trust in the web vendor. That is, these factors, especially web site quality and reputation, are powerful levers that vendors can use to build consumer trust, in order to overcome the negative perceptions people often have about the safety of the web environment. The study also demonstrates that perceived Internet risk negatively affects consumer intentions to transact with a web-based vendor.",2002,11/5/2015 20:54,297�323,,,11,,,The impact of initial consumer trust on intentions to transact with a web site,,,,,,,,,,,,Google Scholar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The program subsidized spending by 20%-90%, depending on school characteristics. Using new data on school technology usage in every school in California from 1996 to 2000 as well as application data from the E-Rate program, the results indicate that the subsidy did succeed in significantly increasing Internet investment. The implied first-dollar price elasticity of demand for Internet investment is between -0.4 and -1.1 and the greatest sensitivity is seen among urban schools and schools with large black and Hispanic student populations. Rural and predominantly white and Asian schools show much less sensitivity. Overall, by the final year of the sample, there were approximately 68% more Internet-connected classrooms per teacher than there would have been without the subsidy.

In contrast, prior research has largely focused on the direct and contemporaneous impacts of IT investments. As a result, we do not fully understand how IT investments are associated with ongoing productivity improvements in future periods and how spillovers influence these gains. In this paper, we examine whether firms receive incremental benefits from IT-related spillovers and whether these spillovers lead to more persistent returns. We focus on the spillovers that accrue to firms from their interindustry transactions, especially the IT services industry. We model and estimate the impact of spillovers on long-run productivity using firm-level data from the manufacturing, transportation, trade, and services sectors. We find that spillover impacts are highly significant, but that the magnitude and persistence of the impacts vary. Firms with high IT intensity receive greater spillover benefits from the IT services industry. Moreover, these benefits are sustained over a long-term horizon. However, the impact of IT-related spillovers does not persist in low IT intensity firms regardless of the source. Overall, our results shed light on the existence and sources of IT-related spillovers and on their important role in shaping the long-run returns to IT investment.

Yet, little is known of how virtual team members come to recognize one another's knowledge, trust one another's expertise, and coordinate their knowledge effectively. In this study, we develop a model of how three behavioral dimensions associated with transactive memory systems (TMS) in virtual teams-expertise location, task-knowledge coordination, and cognition-based trust-and their impacts on team performance change over time. Drawing on the data from a study that involves 38 virtual teams of MBA students performing a complex web-based business simulation game over an 8-week period, we found that in the early stage of the project, the frequency and volume of task-oriented communications among team members played an important role in forming expertise location and cognition-based trust. Once TMS were established, however, task-oriented communication became less important. Instead, toward the end of the project, task-knowledge coordination emerges as a key construct that influences team performance, mediating the impact of all other constructs. Our study demonstrates that TMS can be formed even in virtual team environments where interactions take place solely through electronic media, although they take a relatively long time to develop. Furthermore, our findings show that, once developed, TMS become essential to performing tasks effectively in virtual teams.",2007,11/16/2015 22:49,783-808,,4,31,,MIS Quarterly,,,,,,,,,,,,,JSTOR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Shaping is the continuous revision of one's own and others' contributions to a Wiki. Shaping promotes knowledge reuse through improved knowledge integration. Recognizing and clarifying the role of shaping allows us to theorize new ways in which knowledge resources affect knowledge reuse. We examine the role of three knowledge resources of a Wiki contributor: knowledge depth, knowledge breadth, and assessment of the level of development of the Wiki community's transactive memory system. We offer preliminary evidence based on a sample of experienced organizational Wiki users that the three different knowledge resources have differential effects on shaping, that these effects differ from the effects on the more common user behavior of simply adding domain knowledge to a Wiki, and that shaping and adding each independently affect contributors' perceptions that their knowledge in the Wiki has been reused for organizational improvement. By empirically distinguishing between the different knowledge antecedents and consequences of shaping and adding, we derive implications for theory and research on knowledge integration and reuse.",2013-06,3/20/2016 23:03,455-A12,,2,37,,MIS Quarterly,,,,,,,,,,,,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We then apply this process-based conceptualization to derive research propositions regarding the influence of sensegiving message content (about OIT attributes) on managerial pre-adoption cognitive processing.

Managing extreme amounts of data can be complex and challenging at a time when information is increasingly viewed as a strategic resource. Since the dominant focus of the information technology (IT) governance literature has been on how firms govern physical IT artifacts (hardware, software, networks), the goal of this study is to extend the theory of IT governance by uncovering the structures and practices used to govern information artifacts. Through detailed interviews with 37 executives in 30 organizations across 17 industries, we discover a range of structural, procedural, and relational practices used to govern information within a nomological net that includes the antecedents of these practices and their effects on firm performance. While some antecedents enable the speedy adoption of information governance, others can delay or limit the adoption of information governance practices. Once adopted, however, information governance can help to boost firm performance. By incorporating these results into an extended theory of IT governance, we note how information governance practices can unlock value from the ever-expanding mountains of data currently held within organizations.",2013,2/19/2016 23:10,141�178,,3,30,,,The information artifact in IT governance,,,,,,,,,,,,Google Scholar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These studies treat the field in different ways: as an aggregator of terms, a complex adaptive system, part of a knowledge market, and an evolving biological system. The four perspectives offer different ways of framing the question of progress. I describe these perspectives and make the case based on the conclusions formed from logic and data that the field has indeed progressed splendidly. I argue that the field is maturing and making a contribution, and we should be proud of what we have accomplished. However, through each perspective, I also identify some vicious circles to avoid if we are to continue to progress.

We critique their discussion of errors of inclusion and exclusion in IS research and highlight the potential misinterpretations that are possible from a literal reading of their comments. Our conclusion is that following Benbasat and Zmud's nomological net will result in a micro focus for IS research. The results of such a focus are potentially dangerous for the field. They could result in the elimination of IS from many academic programs. We present an alternative set of heuristics that can be used to assess what lies within the domain of IS scholarship. We argue that the IS community has a powerful story to tell about the transformational impact of information technology. We believe that a significant portion of our research should be macro studies of the impact of IT. It is important for academic colleagues, deans, and managers to understand the transformational power of the technology.

Despite the importance of theory, questions relating to its form and structure are neglected in comparison with questions relating to epistemology. The essay addresses issues of causality, explanation, prediction, and generalization that underlie an understanding of theory. A taxonomy is proposed that classifies information systems theories with respect to the manner in which four central goals are addressed: analysis, explanation, prediction, and prescription. Five interrelated types of theory are distinguished: (1) theory for analyzing, (2) theory for explaining, (3) theory for predicting, (4) theory for explaining and predicting, and (5) theory for design and action. Examples illustrate the nature of each theory type. The applicability of the taxonomy is demonstrated by classifying a sample of journal articles. The paper contributes by showing that multiple views of theory exist and by exposing the assumptions underlying different viewpoints. In addition, it is suggested that the type of theory under development can influence the choice of an epistemological approach. Support is given for the legitimacy and value of each theory type. The building of integrated bodies of theory that encompass all theory types is advocated.",9/1/2006,9/9/2015 22:27,611-642,,3,30,,MIS Quarterly,,,,,,,,,"Copyright � 2006 Management Information Systems Research Center, University of Minnesota",,,,JSTOR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The role of information systems in organizations has changed dramatically, as have the key stakeholders and the expected benefits of the investments in IS. During this period, IS research has evolved to keep pace with the changing expectations regarding the success of information systems, yet practice tends to lag behind. In this commentary, we discuss five eras of information systems evolution and explain how the perceptions and measures of successful information systems have changed across these eras. By looking at the past and present, we are able to comment on how our understanding of success has evolved over time in research and practice. We discuss the inadequacy of IS success evaluation in practice. Finally, we offer four themes as calls for future action related to the research of information systems success.

These works agree that organizational cognition is far too critical to be ignored as it can impact on IS outcomes. While cognition has been considered in a variety of IS contexts, no specific methodology has dominated. A theory and method suitable to the study of cognition defined as personal constructs that individuals use to understand IT in organizations--is Kelly's (1955) personal construct theory and its cognitive mapping tool known as the repertory grid (RepGrid). This article expounds on the potential of this technique to IS researchers by considering the variety of ways the RepGrid may be employed. The flexibility of the RepGrid is illustrated by examining published studies in IS.

Because of this, the information systems field has become a rich tapestry of theoretical and conceptul foundations. As new theories are brought into the field, particularly theories that have become dominant in other areas, there may be a benefit in pausing to assess their use and contribution in an IS context. The purpose of this paper is to explore and critically evaluate use of the resource-based view of the firm (RBV) by IS researchers. The paper provides a brief review of resource-based theory and then suggests extensions to make the RBV more useful for empirical IS research. First, a typology of key IS resources is presented, and these are then described using six traditional resource attributes. Second, we emphasize the particular importance of looking at both resource complementarity and moderating factors when studying IS resource effects on firm performance. Finally, we discuss three considerations that IS researchers need to address when using the RBV empirically.

The authors review and assess the principal critiques evident in the literature, arguing they fall into eight categories. They conclude the RBV�s core message can withstand criticism from five of these quite well provided the RBV�s variables, boundaries, and applicability are adequately specified. Three critiques that cannot be readily dismissed call for further theorizing and research. They arise from the indeterminate nature of two of the RBV�s basic concepts�resource and value�and the narrow conceptualization of a firm�s competitive advantage. As their suggestions for this work indicate, the authors feel the RBV community has clung to an inappropriately narrow neoclassical economic rationality, thereby diminishing its opportunities for progress. The authors� suggestions may assist with developing the RBV into a more viable theory of competitive advantage, especially if it is moved into a genuinely dynamic framework.",1/1/2010,2/9/2016 19:12,349-372,,1,36,,Journal of Management,The Resource-Based View,,,,,,,en,,,,,jom.sagepub.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Appropriately managing this phase, which we term as the swift response phase (SRP), is vital given its prominent impact on the eventual success of the system. Yet, there is a glaring lack of studies that examine the SRP. Drawing on sensemaking theory and early postadoptive literature, this study seeks to propose a theory-driven model to understand how different support structures facilitate different forms of use-related activities to induce a positive performance in the SRP. The model was tested through a two-stage survey involving 329 nurses. The results demonstrated the discriminating alignment between information system (IS) use-related activity and support structures in enhancing system users� work performance in the SRP. Specifically, suitability of impersonal support moderated the effects of standardized system use and individual adaption on performance, whereas availability of personal support only moderated the effect of nonstandardized system use on performance. For moderating role of personal support, IS specialists support had a lower influence than peer-champion support and peer-user support. This study contributes to the extant literature by (1) conceptualizing the turbulent SRP, (2) applying sensemaking theory to the initial postadoptive stage, (3) adding to the theoretical debate on the value of system use, and (4) unveiling the distinct roles of support structures under different types of use activities. Practical suggestions are provided for organizational management and policy makers to deal with the complexities in the SRP.",6/1/2015,4/14/2016 21:02,418-436,,2,26,,Information Systems Research,The Road to Early Success,,,,,,,,,,,,pubsonline.informs.org (Atypon),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper extends this line of research beyond these demographic and situational variables. Motivated by research that suggests that behavioral models do not universally hold across cultures, the paper identifies espoused national cultural values as an important set of individual difference moderators in technology acceptance. Building on research in psychological anthropology and cultural psychology that assesses cultural traits by personality tests at the individual level of analysis, we argue that individuals espouse national cultural values to differing degrees. These espoused national cultural values of masculinity/femininity, individualism/collectivism, power distance, and uncertainty avoidance are incorporated into an extended model of technology acceptance as moderators. We conducted two studies to test our model. Results indicated that, as hypothesized, social norms are stronger determinants of intended behavior for individuals who espouse feminine and high uncertainty avoidance cultural values. Contrary to expectations, espoused masculinity/femininity values did not moderate the relationship between perceived usefulness and behavioral intention but, as expected, did moderate the relationship between perceived ease of use and behavioral intention.",2006,2/8/2016 0:24,679-704,,3,30,,MIS Quarterly,,,,,,,,,,,,,JSTOR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We build on the knowledge-based view to propose that realizing opportunities often involves significant interactions with external knowledge sources. Organizational design can facilitate a firm's interactions with these sources, while achieving coordination among organizational members engaged in opportunity exploitation. Our analysis of a double-respondent survey involving 536 Danish firms shows that the use of external knowledge sources is positively associated with opportunity exploitation, but the strength of this association is significantly influenced by organizational designs that enable the firm to access external knowledge during the process of exploiting opportunities.

Findings show that weak interunit ties help a project team search for useful knowledge in other subunits but impede the transfer of complex knowledge, which tends to require a strong tie between the two parties to a transfer. Having weak interunit ties speeds up projects when knowledge is not complex but slows them down when the knowledge to be transferred is highly complex.

Here we propose a formal measure of what we label �structural virality� that interpolates between two conceptual extremes: content that gains its popularity through a single, large broadcast and that which grows through multiple generations with any one individual directly responsible for only a fraction of the total adoption. We use this notion of structural virality to analyze a unique data set of a billion diffusion events on Twitter, including the propagation of news stories, videos, images, and petitions. We find that across all domains and all sizes of events, online diffusion is characterized by surprising structural diversity; that is, popular events regularly grow via both broadcast and viral mechanisms, as well as essentially all conceivable combinations of the two. Nevertheless, we find that structural virality is typically low, and remains so independent of size, suggesting that popularity is largely driven by the size of the largest broadcast. Finally, we attempt to replicate these findings with a model of contagion characterized by a low infection rate spreading on a scale-free network. We find that although several of our empirical findings are consistent with such a model, it fails to replicate the observed diversity of structural virality, thereby suggesting new directions for future modeling efforts.

In the absence of fundamental changes to the teaching and learning process, such classrooms may do little but speed up ineffective processes and methods of teaching. Our mapping of technologies to learning models identifies sets of technologies in which management schools should invest in order to informate up and down and ultimately transform the educational environment and processes. For researchers interested in the use of information technology to improve learning processes, the paper provides a theoretical foundation for future work.",1995,1/19/2016 3:09,265-291,,3,19,,MIS Quarterly,The Use of Information Technology to Enhance Management School Education,,,,,,,,,,,,JSTOR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the light of the objectives of a specific research project, various techniques are considered. Analysis of the techniques in relation to specific research project objectives leads to the adoption of a form of Kelly's RepGrid technique for the specific project described here. A detailed description is included about how RepGrids were applied in this instance. It is shown that RepGrids are appropriate for gathering qualitative interview data. The technique provides structure to a �one-to-one� interview. But, at the same time, RepGrids allow sufficient flexibility for the research participants to be able to express their own interpretation about a particular topic. Further, because the content of the data is determined by the research participant researcher bias is reduced. The article concludes by suggesting that the RepGrid technique supports the generation of rich in-depth data and is a reliable research technique for gathering qualitative data about information systems analysts.",1/1/1997,2/11/2016 2:18,67-81,,1,7,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In broad terms, the theory is found to be well supported by empirical evidence. Intentions to perform behaviors of different kinds can be predicted with high accuracy from attitudes toward the behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control; and these intentions, together with perceptions of behavioral control, account for considerable variance in actual behavior. Attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control are shown to be related to appropriate sets of salient behavioral, normative, and control beliefs about the behavior, but the exact nature of these relations is still uncertain. Expectancy-value formulations are found to be only partly successful in dealing with these relations. Optimal rescaling of expectancy and value measures is offered as a means of dealing with measurement limitations. Finally, inclusion of past behavior in the prediction equation is shown to provide a means of testing the theory's sufficiency, another issue that remains unresolved. The limited available evidence concerning this question shows that the theory is predicting behavior quite well in comparison to the ceiling imposed by behavioral reliability.",12/1/1991,4/14/2016 0:44,179-211,,2,50,,Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes,,,,,,,,,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Synthesis of evidence from a wide variety of sources suggests four distinct types of knowledge reuse situations according to the knowledge reuser and the purpose of knowledge reuse. The types involve 1. shared work producers, who produce knowledge they later reuse, 2. shared work practitioners, who reuse each other's knowledge contributions, 3. expertise-seeking novices, and 4. secondary knowledge miners. Each type of knowledge reuser has different requirements for knowledge repositories. Owing to how repositories are created, reusers' requirements often remain unmet. Repositories often require considerable rework to be useful for new reusers, but knowledge producers rarely have the resources and incentives to do a good job of repurposing knowledge. Solutions include careful use of incentives and human and technical intermediaries.",2001,5/5/2016 0:12,57-93,,1,18,,,Toward a theory of knowledge reuse,,,,,,,English,Copyright M. E. Sharpe Inc.

For instance, Chen et al (2012, p. 1166�1168) suggest that business analytics and related technologies can help organisations to �better understand its business and markets� and �leverage opportunities presented by abundant data and domain-specific analytics�. Similarly, LaValle et al (2011, p. 22) report that top-performing organisations �make decisions based on rigorous analysis at more than double the rate of lower performing organisations� and that in such organisations analytic insight is being used to �guide both future strategies and day-to-day operations�. We argue here that while there is some evidence that investments in business analytics can create value, the thesis that �business analytics leads to value� needs deeper analysis. In particular, we argue here that the roles of organisational decision-making processes, including resource allocation processes and resource orchestration processes (Helfat et al, 2007; Teece, 2009), need to be better understood in order to understand how organisations can create value from the use of business analytics. Specifically, we propose that the first-order effects of business analytics are likely to be on decision-making processes and that improvements in organisational performance are likely to be an outcome of superior decision-making processes enabled by business analytics",2014,2/20/2016 0:41,433�441,,4,23,,,Transforming decision-making processes,,,,,,,,,,,,Google Scholar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such a {\em disintermediation} weakened consensus on social relevant issues in favor of rumors, mistrust, and fomented conspiracy thinking -- e.g., chem-trails inducing global warming, the link between vaccines and autism, or the New World Order conspiracy. In this work, we study through a thorough quantitative analysis how different conspiracy topics are consumed in the Italian Facebook. By means of a semi-automatic topic extraction strategy, we show that the most discussed contents semantically refer to four specific categories: {\em environment}, {\em diet}, {\em health}, and {\em geopolitics}. We find similar patterns by comparing users activity (likes and comments) on posts belonging to different semantic categories. However, if we focus on the lifetime -- i.e., the distance in time between the first and the last comment for each user -- we notice a remarkable difference within narratives -- e.g., users polarized on geopolitics are more persistent in commenting, whereas the less persistent are those focused on diet related topics. Finally, we model users mobility across various topics finding that the more a user is active, the more he is likely to join all topics. Once inside a conspiracy narrative users tend to embrace the overall corpus.",8/14/2015,8/2/2016 19:20,e0134641,,8,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,arXiv: 1504.05163,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An online survey of two popular social networking sites, Facebook and MySpace, compared perceptions of trust and privacy concern, along with willingness to share information and develop new relationships. Members of both sites reported similar levels of privacy concern. Facebook members expressed significantly greater trust in both Facebook and its members, and were more willing to share identifying information. Even so, MySpace members reported significantly more experience using the site to meet new people. These results suggest that in online interaction, trust is not as necessary in the building of new relationships as it is in face to face encounters. They also show that in an online site, the existence of trust and the willingness to share information do not automatically translate into new social interaction. This study demonstrates online relationships can develop in sites where perceived trust and privacy safeguards are weak.",2007-08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Keystone, Colorado",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study uses latent semantic analysis to examine a large body of published IS research in order to address this question.  Specifically, the abstracts of all research papers over the time period from 1985 through 2006 published in three top IS research journals�MIS Quarterly, Information Systems Research, and Journal of Management Information Systems�were analyzed.  This analysis identified five core research areas:  (1) information technology and organizations; (2) IS development; (3) IT and individuals; (4) IT and markets; and (5) IT and groups.  Over the time frame of our analysis, these core topics have remained quite stable. However, the specific research themes within each core area have evolved significantly, reflecting research that has focused less on technology development and more on the social context in which information technologies are designed and used.  As such, this analysis demonstrates that the information systems academic discipline has maintained a relatively stable research identity that focuses on how IT systems are developed and how individuals, groups, organizations, and markets interact with IT.",2008-09,,467-482,,3,32,,MISQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Theoretically grounded empirical research is needed both to expand our understanding of digital inequality and to inform effective policy making and intervention. The context of our investigation is a city government project, known as the LaGrange Internet TV initiative, which allowed all city residents to access the Internet via their cable televisions at no additional cost. We examine the residents' post-implementation continued use intentions through a decomposed theory of planned behavior perspective, which is elaborated to include personal network exposure. Differences in the behavioral models between socio-economically advantaged and disadvantaged users who have direct usage experience are theorized and empirically tested. The results reveal distinct behavioral models and isolate the key factors that differentially impact the two groups. The advantaged group has a higher tendency to respond to personal network exposure. Enjoyment and confidence in using information and communication technologies, availability, and perceived behavioral control are more powerful in shaping continued ICT use intention for the disadvantaged.

In this study, the existing literature on organizational climate, job characteristics, and organizational learning (in the form of cooperative learning theory) are linked with the current thinking and research findings related to knowledge management to develop a theoretical model explaining the relationships among organizational climate, the level of cooperative learning that takes place between knowledge workers, and the resulting level of knowledge created and disseminated as measured by team performance and individual satisfaction levels.

We propose that adopting KM activities that match the tacitness and learnability of organizational work settings will have a positive effect on desirable performance targets for each work environment. Our framework offers a new lens for defining work and work settings. We identify patterns of KM activity that are believed to be maximally effective within each work setting and offer an enhanced contingency-based explanation of the association among work settings, KM initiatives, and performance.

In this paper, we (1) review user acceptance literature and discuss eight prominent models, (2) empirically compare the eight models and their extensions, (3) formulate a unified model that integrates elements across the eight models, and (4) empirically validate the unified model. The eight models reviewed are the theory of reasoned action, the technology acceptance model, the motivational model, the theory of planned behavior, a model combining the technology acceptance model and the theory of planned behavior, the model of PC utilization, the innovation diffusion theory, and the social cognitive theory. Using data from four organizations over a six-month period with three points of measurement, the eight models explained between 17 percent and 53 percent of the variance in user intentions to use information technology. Next, a unified model, called the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), was formulated, with four core determinants of intention and usage, and up to four moderators of key relationships. UTAUT was then tested using the original data and found to outperform the eight individual models (adjusted R of 69 percent). UTAUT was then confirmed with data from two new organizations with similar results (adjusted R of 70 percent). UTAUT thus provides a useful tool for managers needing to assess the likelihood of success for new technology introductions and helps them understand the drivers of acceptance in order to proactively design interventions (including training, marketing, etc.) targeted at populations of users that may be less inclined to adopt and use new systems. The paper also makes several recommendations for future research including developing a deeper understanding of the dynamic influences studied here, refining measurement of the core constructs used in UTAUT, and understanding the organizational outcomes associated with new technology use.",2003,2/8/2016 0:28,425-478,,3,27,,MIS Quarterly,User Acceptance of Information Technology,,,,,,,,,,,,JSTOR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Instead, the study provides support for the sociotechnical theory-in-use. For critical researchers and skeptical practitioners, the overarching lesson of our case study is that business process redesign is but the latest arena in which researchers and practitioners are relearning old lessons by repeating the past mistake of adopting a technocentric approach and sociocentric approach to designing and managing organizations. The future direction we suggest for researchers and practitioners interested in areas such as BPR, ERP, and e-commerce implementation, all of which involve business process redesign, is to adopt, from the beginning, an orientation that is not just technocentric or sociocentric, but gives equal consideration to the technical and social dimensions, and the interactions between the social and the technological.",2002-01,,Jul-79,,1,2,,JAIS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The method offers a systematic way to generate theory from data, but is rarely used to its full potential in IS as a number of myths and misunderstandings about GTM prevent researchers from getting the full potential out of the method. To address this problem, we advance the general level of knowledge of GTM. We clarify aspects of the method that are often misunderstood by novice users or casual observers and provide guidance to address common problems. Exemplars from the IS literature are used to illustrate the concepts and to promote the informed use of the methodology.

This article demonstrates how SNA can be used to study the nature of the IS discipline, by presenting results from an exploratory SNA of 125 previously ranked journals from IS and allied disciplines. While many of the most prominent journals in the network are still associated with IS's foundational disciplines, we identify several IS journals that play important roles in disseminating information throughout different subcomponents of the network. We also identify related groups of journals based not only on patterns of information flow, but also on similarity in citation patterns. This enables us to identify the core set of journals that is important for ""pure IS"" research, as well as other subsets of journals that are important for specialty areas of interest. Overall, results indicate that the IS discipline is still somewhat fragmented and is still a net receiver, as opposed to a net provider, of information from allied disciplines. Like other forms of analysis, SNA is not entirely free from biases. However, these biases can be systematically researched in order to develop an improved, consistent tool with which to examine the IS field via citations among member journals. Thus, while many challenges remain in applying SNA techniques to the study of IS journals, the opportunity to track trends in the discipline over time, with a larger basket of journals, suggests a number of valuable future applications of SNA for understanding the IS publication system.",2009-08,9/5/2015 18:05,595-636,,8,10,,Journal of the Association for Information Systems,,,,,,,,,,,,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sourcing decisions are one of the strategic decisions because they enable companies to reduce costs and improve profit figures. The main task in sourcing is vendor selection. Recent challenges such as shortened product life cycle, just-in-time environment, and the importance of strategic partnerships in upstream chains always influence companies to prioritise vendor selection. In addition, outsourced parts and components account for a significant contribution in the cost of finished goods. Thus evaluating and selecting the right vendor is the key to business. Vendors are selected merely on the basis of cost factors in the traditional approach. However, companies eventually have understood that their approach which emphasises costs as the sole criterion is inefficient and needs to be changed. To deal with the complex process of vendor evaluation, multiple criteria decision-making techniques have evolved. This study presents the integrated approach of multiple multi criteria decision making (MCDM) techniques such as fuzzy logic, strength-weakness-opportunity-threat (SWOT) analysis, and data envelopment analysis. The efficacy of the proposed approach is evident from the case study of an automotive component manufacturer involving 20 vendors, comprising of pre-qualification by fuzzy SWOT and final selection by DEA.",2013-03,4/14/2016 4:37,1535-1548,,5,51,,International Journal of Production Research,Vendor selection problem,,,,,,,,,,,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

UZHZ3JXQ,journalArticle,2016,,Virtual Team Performance: A Collaboration-Centric Framework,,,,,,"The rapid evolution in collaboration technologies has resulted in heightened interest in  enterprises to leverage these technologies to achieve better performance from their  geographically distributed virtual teams. The Collaboration Centric Framework (CCF),  presented in this paper integrates theories of technology appropriation with theories of  team behavior to provide insights into the dynamic behavior and interplay of three  components: virtual teams, collaboration technologies and work. Since the use of  collaboration technologies primarily enables and stimulates the collaboration process  among virtual team members, CCF employs the collaboration process as a central  construct to bind the three components and to explain the dynamics of virtual team  performance. By introducing the constructs of collaboration effectiveness of technology  environment and collaboration requirement of work, and by incorporating feedback from  work done on collaboration behavior of virtual team members, CCF formalizes the  interplay among the three components. CCF is able to show that there are four profiles  that capture the majority of the normative behaviors of virtual team productivity over  time, including a counter-intuitive team productivity profile that reflects a monotonic drop  in team performance over time.  We believe that CCF opens up new avenues for  research as well as practical applications to gain insight into performance of virtual  teams operating in different work and collaboration technology environments.

Yet the empirical evidence supporting such claims remains largely indirect. As a consequence, few studies have been able to directly examine how contextual factors shape the accumulation of this relational asset or define its value in application. We directly measure the value of relationships between suppliers and a large buyer, using the buyer�s choices in Internet-enabled procurement auctions to estimate the degree to which stronger relationship histories with suppliers increase willingness to pay for high-volume commodity-like parts. Our setting also allows us to examine how this willingness to pay for relationships is shaped by the social context in which they develop and by the exchange context in which they are subsequently deployed, while minimizing the confounding influence any private individual interests have on the choice of exchange partners. Our empirical analysis suggests that, even for commodity parts, prior repeated exchange between firms constitutes a valuable relational asset. We also find evidence that suggests that both social mechanisms and incentive considerations underpin the value of relational capital. Further, we find that relational capital exhibits more value when exchange hazards are greater.",5/8/2013,4/21/2016 0:49,222-244,,1,25,,Organization Science,What Is a Relationship Worth?,,,,,,,,,,,,pubsonline.informs.org.ezproxy.baylor.edu (Atypon),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While this literature acknowledges that individuals express the self through ownership  and use of cell phones, our understanding of the interplay between cell phones and how  one defines the self is nascent. Understanding this phenomenon is important, since cell  phones have a central place in the social interactions in which people come to know  themselves and act. To this end, we conducted an exploratory study to shed light on  young adults� self-identification with cell phones. Based on our findings, in consultation  with relevant literature, we conceptualized self-identification as being reflected in three  interrelated dimensions that vary based on the types of meanings that young adults  construct through cell phone use. Our findings imply that self-identification develops over  time, as cell phone use becomes increasingly embedded in everyday life. We found that  self-esteem, as an outcome of behaviors that confirm a person�s imagined view of the  self, reinforces self-identification with cell phones, which, in turn, influences future  behaviors. On this basis, we suggested potential opportunities for future studies to  advance research on self-identification and IT beyond the context of young adults and  cell phones",,,,,,in review,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This article outlines several key differences between traditional offline social networks and online social media networks by juxtaposing an established typology of social network research with a well-regarded definition of social media platforms that articulates four key features. The results show that at four major points of intersection, social media has considerable theoretical implications for SNA. In exploring these points of intersection, this study outlines a series of theoretically distinct research questions for SNA in social media contexts. These points of intersection offer considerable opportunities for researchers to investigate the theoretical implications introduced by social media and lay the groundwork for a robust social media agenda potentially spanning multiple disciplines.",2014-03,2/16/2016 3:15,275-304,,1,38,,MIS Quarterly,What's Different About Social Media Networks?,,,,,,,,,,,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigate under what conditions repository KMS use leads to higher performance outcomes in a retail grocery context. We use a unique longitudinal dataset composed of objective measures of KMS use and sales performance of 273 managers over 146 weeks collected from a retail grocery chain. We obtain two main results. First, we find a diminishing impact of KMS use for managers who also use other sources of codified knowledge, namely physical or computerized alternative knowledge sources, whereas a complementary relationship seems to exist between KMS use and social sources of knowledge. Second, KMS use produces higher benefits for managers whose task environments require a greater volume of information and knowledge, but smaller benefits for those managers whose task environments demand rapidly changing information and knowledge.

Drawing on organizational capabilities and knowledge-sharing research, we develop a situated performance view that holds that the value of obtaining and using knowledge within a firm depends on the task situation. Using a data set of 182 sales proposals for client work in a management consulting company, we show that sales teams that had varying needs to learn and differentiate themselves from competitors derived different levels of value from obtaining and using electronic documents and advice from colleagues. Highly experienced teams were more likely than inexperienced teams to lose the sales bids if they utilized such knowledge. Teams that had a high need to differentiate themselves from competitors also had a lower chance of winning if they utilized electronic documents. There were situations, however, where teams performed better if they utilized the firm's knowledge resources. These results suggest that competitive performance depends not on how much firms know but on how they use what they know.

Examining Social Capital and Knowledge Contribution in Electronic Networks of Practice,MIS Quarterly,,2767783,,http://search.proquest.com.ezproxy.baylor.edu/docview/218122431/abstract,"Electronic networks of practice are computer-mediated discussion forums focused on problems of practice that enable individuals to exchange advice and ideas with others based on common interests. However, why individuals help strangers in these electronic networks is not well understood: there is no immediate benefit to the contributor, and free-riders are able to acquire the same knowledge as everyone else. To understand this paradox, we apply theories of collective action to examine how individual motivations and social capital influence knowledge contribution in electronic networks. This study reports on the activities of one electronic network supporting a professional legal association. Using archival, network, survey, and content analysis data, we empirically test a model of knowledge contribution. We find that people contribute their knowledge when they perceive that it enhances their professional reputations, when they have the experience to share, and when they are structurally embedded in the network. Surprisingly, contributions occur without regard to expectations of reciprocity from others or high levels of commitment to the network.

There are currently 5,120,683 articles in the English Wikipedia. Wikipedia continues to grow, and the number of articles in Wikipedia is increasing by over 20,000 a month. The number of articles added to Wikipedia every month reached its maximum in 2006, at over 50,000 new articles a month, and has been slowly but steadily declining since then. While this might seem to show that Wikipedia's growth is slowing or stopping, it should be noted that the amount of text added to Wikipedia articles every year has been constant since 2006, at roughly 1 gigabyte of (compressed) text added per year. This implies that as time progresses proportionally more content is added to existing articles rather than new articles, and that Wikipedia has maintained the same persistent rate of growth throughout the past decade. Most of the earlier entries were extracted from Wikipedia:Announcements. Later entries are taken from observations of the new software's built-in article count features.

This paper argues that the value of external knowledge sharing increases when work groups are more structurally diverse. A structurally diverse work group is one in which the members, by virtue of their different organizational affiliations, roles, or positions, can expose the group to unique sources of knowledge. It is hypothesized that if members of structurally diverse work groups engage in external knowledge sharing, their performance will improve because of this active exchange of knowledge through unique external sources. A field study of 182 work groups in a Fortune 500 telecommunications firm operationalizes structural diversity as member differences in geographic locations, functional assignments, reporting managers, and business units, as indicated by corporate database records. External knowledge sharing was measured with group member surveys and performance was assessed using senior executive ratings. Ordered logit analyses showed that external knowledge sharing was more strongly associated with performance when work groups were more structurally diverse. Implications for theory and practice around the integration of work groups and social networks are addressed.",3/1/2004,7/23/2016 23:36,352-364,,3,50,,Management Science,,,,,,,,,,,,,pubsonline.informs.org (Atypon),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BJ9KNP3G,book,1998,"Davenport, Thomas H.; Prusak, Laurence",Working Knowledge: How Organizations Manage what They Know,,978-0-87584-655-2,,,,"The definitive primer on knowledge management, this book will establish the enduring vocabulary and concepts and serve as the hands-on resource of choice for fast companies that recognize knowledge as the only sustainable source of competitive advantage. Drawing on their work with more than 30 knowledge-rich firms, the authors-experienced consultants with a track record of success-examine how all types of companies can effectively understand, analyze, measure, and manage their intellectual assets, turning corporate knowledge into market value. They consider such questions as: What key cultural and behavioral issues must managers address to use knowledge effectively?; What are the best ways to incorporate technology into knowledge work?; What does a successful knowledge project look like-and how do you know when it has succeeded? In the end, say the authors, the human qualities of knowledge-experience, intuition, and beliefs-are the most valuable and the most difficult to manage. Applying the insights of Working Knowledge is every manager's first step on that rewarding road to long-term success. A Library Journal Best Business Book of the Year. ""For an entire company...to have knowledge, that information must be coordinated and made accessible. Thomas H. Davenport...and Laurence Prusak... offer an elegantly simple overview of the 'knowledge market' aimed at fulfilling that goal....

This white paper, however, is going to take a different angle. Instead of talking about the so-called �best practices� in forecasting, we will instead expose the seamy underbelly of the forecasting profession. Rather than asking you to implement all the various things the really good forecasting organizations do, we want to help you avoid the things the really bad forecasting organizations do. Perhaps the surest way to achieve process improvements is by identifying and eliminating the worst practices in forecasting. You are sure to recognize many of these worst practices. Of course, not as anything you yourself have ever done, but perhaps as something you�ve heard about, or maybe observed a colleague or a friend commit. The point of exposing these worst practices is not necessarily to embarrass anyone, or to poke fun at the organizations that commit them. Often the best way to learn is by making mistakes, and that�s why we alI feel perfectly at home in the forecasting profession, as opposed to being in a profession such as brain surgery. The purpose of this white paper is to help you make new mistakes, not repeat those made by yourself, your colleagues or this author.",2015,2/27/2016,,,,,,,,,,,,SAS Institute Inc,,,,White Paper,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
